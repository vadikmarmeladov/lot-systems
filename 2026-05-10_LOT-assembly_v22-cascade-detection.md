## Feedback Signal Extracted

From USERSHIP_TRANSMISSION (v21, 2026-05-09):
- Explicit next target stated verbatim: **"Pattern 40 — biofield-coherence-cascade (recovery arc → cognitive expansion → full-coherence within 24h)."**
- The system itself surfaced this as the next logical build in the prior session.

From SESSION_REPORTS trajectory:
- v21 closed two pattern loops: recovery arc (care → mood) and cognitive expansion (memory + journal + goals). The cascade — detecting when both fire together — was the named gap.
- Pattern naming has been the consistent vocabulary: terse, technical, alive. Each pattern is a detection, not a label.

---

## Delta Analysis

**Priority 1 — Explicit next target:**
- Pattern 40 (biofield-coherence-cascade): stated in v21 USERSHIP_TRANSMISSION. Build it.

**Priority 2 — Logical extension:**
- Pattern 41 (resonant-synthesis): cascade + reflection-velocity + signal diversity. The three-layer state that only emerges when cascade + deepening reflection are both active. Named the synthesis state.
- Archetype 12 (Resonant Builder): the person in full cascade. No archetype existed for the cascade-active state. Gap closed.
- PatternRecognitionWidget: 4 patterns (38, 39, 40, 41) had no readable names in the display layer. Added.

**Priority 3 — Infrastructure:**
- Logs.tsx: CASCADE and SYNTH handlers for the two new event types.
- SystemProgressWidget: v22 SESSION_REPORTS entry + USERSHIP_TRANSMISSION update.

**Deferred (Priority 3–4):**
- Pattern 42 (deep-work-cascade) — stated as next in v22 USERSHIP_TRANSMISSION. Deferred to v23.
- Wiki v6 update — deferred to a dedicated wiki session.
- Additional dep map nodes — 66 nodes is dense enough for this session.

## What Was Built

### `src/client/stores/intentionEngine.ts`

**Pattern 40 — biofield-coherence-cascade** (lines 949–967):
- Detects when Patterns 38 (biofield-recovery-arc) AND 39 (cognitive-expansion) are both active in the current analysis cycle
- AND 3+ primary modules (journal / memory / planner / selfcare) fired in the last 6h window
- Confidence: 0.72 + (primaryActive - 3) × 0.10, capped at 0.92
- suggestedWidget: 'system', suggestedTiming: 'passive'
- Reason: "Full cascade: recovery arc → cognitive expansion → N/4 primary modules coherent."

**Pattern 41 — resonant-synthesis** (lines 971–984):
- Detects when Pattern 40 (cascade) AND Pattern 37 (reflection-velocity) are both active
- AND 5+ unique signal sources fired in the last 7d window
- Confidence: 0.65 + sourcesActive × 0.04, capped at 0.90
- suggestedWidget: 'memory', suggestedTiming: 'passive'
- Reason: full synthesis state across recovery, cognition, and reflection layers

**Archetype 12 — Resonant Builder** (PHYSIOLOGICAL_ARCHETYPES array):
- energyBands: ['moderate', 'high']
- dominantSources: ['memory', 'journal', 'goals']
- patternConditions: ['biofield-coherence-cascade', 'resonant-synthesis', 'cognitive-expansion']
- directive: 'Full cascade achieved. Recovery + cognition + structure converging. Anchor this state.'

### `src/client/components/Logs.tsx`

**CASCADE handler** (biofield_coherence_cascade event):
- Renders: "Full cascade detected" + primary module count + confidence + cascade chain label
- Military format: `CASCADE: [label]`

**SYNTH handler** (resonant_synthesis event):
- Renders: "Resonant synthesis" + sources active in 7d + synthesis label
- Military format: `SYNTH: [label]`

### `src/client/components/PatternRecognitionWidget.tsx`

Name map additions:
- `'biofield-recovery-arc'` → `'Recovery arc complete'`
- `'cognitive-expansion'` → `'Cognitive architecture building'`
- `'biofield-coherence-cascade'` → `'Full coherence cascade'`
- `'resonant-synthesis'` → `'Resonant synthesis state'`

### `src/client/components/SystemProgressWidget.tsx`

- SESSION_REPORTS: v22 entry appended (date: 2026-05-10)
- USERSHIP_TRANSMISSION: updated to v22 / 2026-05-10
- Next stated: Pattern 42 — deep-work-cascade

## Test Results

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| TypeScript check (tsc --noEmit) | PASS — only pre-existing infra errors (missing @types, deprecated tsconfig options), none from changed files |
| Pattern 40 logic review | PASS — depends on patterns array built in same analyzeIntentions call; cascade fires only after P38 + P39 confirmed active |
| Pattern 41 logic review | PASS — depends on Pattern 40 being in current patterns array; correct ordering |
| Archetype 12 scoring | PASS — added to PHYSIOLOGICAL_ARCHETYPES array before the classifier function; scores computed correctly |
| Logs.tsx CASCADE handler | PASS — correct else-if chain position before generic fallback |
| Logs.tsx SYNTH handler | PASS — correct else-if chain position before generic fallback |
| PatternRecognitionWidget map | PASS — 4 entries added without removing existing entries |
| SystemProgressWidget session log | PASS — v22 entry appended to SESSION_REPORTS array |
| USERSHIP_TRANSMISSION | PASS — updated date and message, next target stated |
| Vowel inversion / grid style | PASS — no new UI introduced; existing LOT style preserved |
| Mobile / desktop render | N/A — no structural layout changes |

## Deploy Confirmation

- **Commit hash:** `8c50260`
- **Branch pushed:** `claude/loving-goldberg-xDb8O` (dev) + `claude/quantum-engine-widgets-RgFfC` (deploy target)
- **Push verification:** Both confirmed accepted by remote
- **Files changed:** 4 files, 114 insertions, 12 deletions

## What Was Deferred

- **Pattern 42 (deep-work-cascade):** stated in v22 USERSHIP_TRANSMISSION as next. Deferred — v23 run.
- **Wiki v6:** vocabulary update for cascade / synthesis / Resonant Builder. Deferred — dedicated wiki session.
- **Additional dep map nodes:** 66 nodes already comprehensive. Deferred until a widget is added that lacks dep coverage.
- **Archetype directive table in SystemProgressWidget report view:** now has 12 archetypes; table was built for 8. May need expansion next run.

---

## Next Session Recommendation

Build Pattern 42 (deep-work-cascade: memory + planner + journal + goals all firing in 3h window, no anxiety/overwhelm signals) and surface it in the Pattern Recognition widget's QOS Trend view as a "deep work window open" indicator.

*The cascade is named. The synthesis is visible. 41 patterns. 12 archetypes. The Cube now detects its own peak state.*
