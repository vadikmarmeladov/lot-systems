**Your task:** Generate ONE question that EXPLORES A NEW TOPIC AREA we haven't covered yet:
1. **Choose an unexplored area** - READ their Memory Story above and identify what aspects of their life we DON'T know about yet
2. **Start fresh on a NEW topic** - Don't follow up on recent answers, but ask about a completely different dimension of their life
3. **Build story breadth** - Each question should explore a different dimension of their lifestyle
4. **Is contextually relevant** - Consider current time and weather

**REQUIREMENT:** Your question should be informed by their profile (use their archetype and cohort info) but explore a NEW area we haven't asked about. Review the list of previous questions above and choose a completely different topic.

**Examples of exploring new topics:**
- If we know their morning beverage → Ask about their meal preferences
- If we know their clothing style → Ask about their evening wind-down routine
- If we know their social boundaries → Ask about their workspace preferences
- If we know their food choices → Ask about their movement/exercise habits

**Topic areas to explore (choose one we haven't covered):**
- Morning/evening routines and rituals
- Food, beverages, and meal preferences
- Clothing, fabrics, and comfort
- Self-care, skincare, and wellness
- Social energy and recharge methods
- Work environment and productivity
- Seasonal preferences and adaptation
- Movement, posture, and physical awareness
- Sleep and rest patterns
- Creative or hobby pursuits

${cohortInfo ? `**Soul Archetype Question Guidance:**
Tailor your question to their soul archetype "${archetype}":
- "The Seeker": Ask deep questions about growth, self-discovery, transformation, inner wisdom
- "The Nurturer": Explore connection, caring for others, emotional bonds, community support
- "The Achiever": Focus on goals, accomplishment, progress tracking, purposeful action
- "The Philosopher": Probe meaning, purpose, life's deeper questions, existential reflection
- "The Harmonizer": Ask about balance, peace-finding, conflict resolution, inner equilibrium
- "The Creator": Inquire about self-expression, creative process, artistic manifestation, innovation
- "The Protector": Explore safety needs, boundary-setting, stability creation, grounding practices
- "The Authentic": Focus on truth-telling, self-honesty, genuine expression, living aligned
- "The Explorer": Ask about new experiences, adventure, curiosity, expanding horizons
- "The Wanderer": Invite self-discovery, identity exploration, path-finding, openness to change

The question should speak to their SOUL LEVEL, not just surface behaviors. Make them think, feel, and reflect on who they truly are.` : ''}

- Reference their previous answer briefly
- No lengthy explanations

**Examples of BRIEF follow-ups:**
- "What time usually?" → Options: "Morning", "Afternoon", "Evening"
- "How often?" → Options: "Daily", "Few times weekly", "Occasionally"
- "What temperature?" → Options: "Hot", "Warm", "Cold"

      taskInstructions = `
**Your task:** Generate ONE personalized follow-up question with 3-4 answer choices that:
1. **MUST EXPLICITLY reference their previous answers** - CRITICAL: Your question MUST start with a reference phrase like "You mentioned...", "Since you said...", "Last time you chose...", "Building on your answer about..." followed by SPECIFIC details from their actual answers shown above
2. **Builds PROGRESSIVELY deeper into their psychological and soul profile** - Each follow-up should probe ONE level deeper than the previous question, moving from surface behaviors → underlying motivations → core values → soul-level identity
3. **Is contextually relevant** - Consider current time, weather, and their recent activity patterns

**STRICT REQUIREMENT:** Your question cannot be generic. It must demonstrate you've read their Memory Story above by referencing specific details from their actual answers. Generic questions that could apply to anyone are FORBIDDEN.

**CRITICAL: Progressive Depth Requirement:**
Follow-ups must build on BOTH behavioral patterns AND psychological/soul dimensions:
- **First follow-up**: Surface behavior details (how, when, what specifically)
- **Second follow-up**: Motivations and reasons (why this choice, what it provides)
- **Third follow-up**: Values and meaning (what this reveals about priorities, what matters)
- **Fourth+ follow-up**: Soul-level identity (who they are becoming, their deeper nature)

**CRITICAL: User-Feedback Loop Requirements:**
- READ the "User's Memory Story" section above CAREFULLY before generating your question
- You MUST explicitly reference AT LEAST ONE specific detail from their previous answers (not generic, use their actual answer text)
- Show you remember what they told you - use phrases like "You mentioned...", "Since you prefer...", "Last time you chose...", "Building on your answer about..."
- If they have journal entries, acknowledge their deeper thoughts and feelings - their journal reveals what truly matters to them
- The question should feel like you're having an ongoing conversation, not starting fresh each time
- Make connections between their different answers AND journal reflections to show you understand their overall lifestyle and inner world

**EXAMPLE of GOOD reference:**
User's Memory Story shows: "What do you prefer for breakfast? → User chose: 'Greek yogurt with honey'"
GOOD question: "Since you enjoy Greek yogurt with honey for breakfast, what do you usually pair it with?"
BAD question: "What matters most to you?" (completely ignores their history)

**Examples of progressive follow-up questions:**
LEVEL 1 (Behavior details): "Since you mentioned enjoying tea in the morning, how do you usually prepare it?" (Options: Quick tea bag, Loose leaf ritual, Matcha ceremony)
LEVEL 2 (Motivations): "You chose 'Loose leaf ritual' - what does this morning ritual provide for you?" (Options: Peaceful start, Mindful moment, Sensory pleasure)
LEVEL 3 (Values): "This ritual seems important to you. What value does it honor?" (Options: Presence, Self-care, Beauty in simplicity)
LEVEL 4 (Soul identity): "Reflecting on this practice, what does it reveal about who you're becoming?" (Options: Someone who values slowness, A mindful being, One who honors small rituals)

${cohortInfo ? `**Soul Archetype Follow-Up Guidance:**
Build deeper into their soul archetype "${archetype}" with this follow-up:
- "The Seeker": Connect growth practices (morning reflection → evening integration), deepen self-awareness
- "The Nurturer": Explore care rituals (how you care for others → how you care for yourself)
- "The Achiever": Link accomplishment patterns (morning productivity → evening reflection on progress)
- "The Philosopher": Probe meaning-making (what matters to you → why it matters, life philosophy)
- "The Harmonizer": Deepen balance practices (finding peace in mornings → maintaining it through challenges)
- "The Creator": Progress through creative process (inspiration → manifestation → expression)
- "The Protector": Connect safety needs (physical boundaries → emotional boundaries)
- "The Authentic": Explore honesty layers (being honest with self → being honest with others)
- "The Explorer": Build on curiosity (what you're exploring → what you're discovering about yourself)
- "The Wanderer": Invite clarity emergence (what you're questioning → what's becoming clearer)

CRITICAL: Make the follow-up SOUL-TOUCHING - reference their previous answer AND probe their deeper nature. Ask questions that make them pause and truly reflect on who they are becoming.` : ''}

6. Ensure each insight is a complete sentence
7. Do not use asterisks, bullets (•), or other symbols - only the en dash (–)

Example format:

${cohortInfo ? `**Cohort-specific guidance:**
Use the user's cohort profile to guide your suggestion:
- "Wellness Enthusiast": Focus on nutrient-dense, mindful meals (smoothie bowls, buddha bowls, herbal teas)
- "Plant-Based": Ensure 100% plant-based ingredients (tofu, tempeh, legumes, nuts)
- "Busy Professional": Quick prep, minimal cooking (overnight oats, grab-and-go salads, pre-prepped ingredients)
- "Comfort Seeker": Warm, soothing, nostalgic foods (porridge, soup, baked goods, tea)
- "Culinary Explorer": Unique ingredients or preparations (matcha, kimchi, tahini, exotic spices)
- "Protein-Focused": Include clear protein source (eggs, chicken, fish, Greek yogurt, protein)
- "Health-Conscious": Emphasize fresh, whole foods (salads, lean proteins, vegetables, fruits)
- "Classic Comfort": Traditional, familiar recipes (scrambled eggs, grilled cheese, chicken soup)
- "Balanced Lifestyle": Well-rounded, moderate approach (mix of macros, variety)

**IMPORTANT**: The cohort and traits are derived from pattern analysis. Prioritize their cohort profile over generic suggestions.

**Examples of good suggestions:**
- "Warm oatmeal with cinnamon and banana" (cold morning, comfort seeker)
- "Chilled cucumber and avocado salad" (hot day, health-conscious)
- "Tofu scramble with turmeric and greens" (morning, plant-based)
- "Quick Greek yogurt bowl with berries" (busy professional, protein-focused)
