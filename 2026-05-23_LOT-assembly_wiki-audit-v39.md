## Feedback Signal Extracted

Verbatim user directives driving this run:
> "scan all working branches, its style and all of the .MDs on the GitHub"
> "compress and clean the information, please keep the style of the Computer Manual and Sci-Fi"
> "please in details explain all of the badges, cohorts and internal vocabulary"
> "continue building the site according to the rendered Wiki"
> "refine interface towards more simplicity and military purity"
> "constantly refine the language and vocabulary to create the LOT atmosphere from the computer future"

## What Was Built

### 1. Field Manual v38 → v39

Updated sidebar version string. Updated header paragraph day counter to Day 981+.

### 2. Operating Status Update

Updated `Self-Assembly phase:` row to reference v39. Added v39 description to the long operating status narrative. Appended v39 closure note to the self-assembly phase log narrative paragraph.

### 3. Badge Trigger Conditions (Complete)

**Aquatic Evolution** (active system): Added exact trigger mechanics for all three tiers:
- ∘ Droplet: `badge_unlock` fires post-Memory-answer when streak ≥ 7 and `milestone_7` not yet awarded
- ≈ Wave: Same pattern at streak ≥ 30
- ≋ Current: Same pattern at streak ≥ 100
- Added race condition guard documentation, queue system, localStorage try-catch notation

**Architecture Theme**: Added unlock transmission sequences (missing from previous versions).

### 4. Assembly Transmission Layer — Formal Documentation

Added `SubHeading` block in Core Engines section. Documents:
- Fifth cycle point in System Progress widget
- Navigation cycle order (deployment → assembly → feedback → report → transmission → deployment)
- ASSEMBLY_TRANSMISSIONS typed array structure (date, built, feedbackApplied, status, next)
- Display specifications (reverse-chron, opacity hierarchy, military-log aesthetic)
- Semantic distinction: transmission is a field report, not a status update

Added vocabulary entry: `Assembly Transmission Layer` in System Architecture Terms.
Added vocabulary entry: `SESSION_REPORTS` (canonical build record array).

### 5. Vocabulary Expansion — 30+ Terms Added

**Core Terms (new):**
- Operator (formal definition)
- Field Guide (self-referential definition)
- Transmission (structural vs. event distinction)
- Accumulation (fundamental operating mode)
- Memory Densification (compounding context process)
- Virtuous Compression Cycle (moved from Profile Terms to Core, expanded)

**Signal & State Terms (new):**
- Cascade
- Biofield
- Circadian Phase
- Signal Window
- Confidence Score
- Arc
- Depth
- Coherence

**Interface Terms (new):**
- Military Purity (aesthetic standard)
- Conditional Rendering (gate types)
- IIFE Pattern (rendering idiom)

**Operational Terms (new):**
- Proactive Surface
- Intervention (expanded)
- Field Log
- Military Log Code
- Tactical Placeholder
- Hard Cap
- Full-Stack Session (moved from other section, expanded)

**Profile Terms (new):**
- Public Profile (complete specification)
- Level: field (rendering conditions)
- Custom URL (storage and collision logic)

**System Architecture Terms (new):**
- Assembly Transmission Layer
- SESSION_REPORTS

### 6. Achievement Registry — Extended

Added `Depth Domain (extended)` with Thousand Answers (1,000 questions — beyond Legendary).
Added Courage Domain entries: Night Voice (22:00–04:00 entry), Year Keeper (365-day span).

### 7. Self-Assembly Phase Log — v39 Entry

Added v39 entry to:
- Phase log table in `self-assembly-log` section
- Release history table
- CodeBlock summary in credits
- CodeBlock summary in self-assembly log
- Operating status `Self-Assembly phase:` row

### 8. Stats Updates

- Credits: "38 phases" → "39 phases"
- CodeBlock: `Day 980+` → `Day 981+`, `v38` → `v39`
- Added `5 Badge paths` to credits CodeBlock
- Day counter row updated to May 23, 2026
- Terms last-updated: May 20 → May 23

## Deploy Confirmation

**Commit message:** `[LOT-ASSEMBLY] 2026-05-23 — Wiki v39 · vocabulary expansion · badge documentation · transmission layer formalized`
**Branch:** `claude/quantum-engine-widgets-RgFfC`
**Push:** `git push -u origin claude/quantum-engine-widgets-RgFfC`

---

## What Was Deferred

- **Log Triggers section expansion** — the `/qos`, `/assembly`, `/phys`, `/sil` triggers are referenced in vocabulary but the Log Triggers section (id="log-triggers") was not found in current About.tsx. Not introduced. Recommend adding as new section in v40.
- **Quest System expansion** — Quest System section exists but quest conditions lack exact trigger specifications. Deferred to v40.
- **Pattern 53** — No new pattern named this session. Pattern library remains at 52. v39 was a documentation phase, not a pattern expansion.
- **Self-Assembly Log section refresh** — The assembly-log section references v38 in some prose. A full prose refresh would benefit from operator review of priorities. Deferred.

---

## Next Session Recommendation

**Log Triggers section:** Add `id="log-triggers"` section documenting all 4 log triggers with exact commands and what they fire:
- `/qos` → fires analyzeIntentions()
- `/assembly` → fires analyzeIntentions()
- `/phys` → cohort report
- `/sil` → silence check

**Pattern 53 candidacy:** The field log currently captures 52 patterns. Candidate: `Morning Presence Void` — no signals in the 06:00–10:00 window for 7+ consecutive days despite afternoon/evening activity. Circadian morning layer missing. Distinct from P.52 (circadian anchor loss) which requires late-night sessions. P.53 detects pure morning absence.
