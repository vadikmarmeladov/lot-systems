# Memory Engine Failure Timeline - Complete Analysis

## 📅 What Happened

### December 23, 2025 - Enhancement Added
**Commit:** `be53c1cf` "Fix Memory Engine duplicate prompts"
- ✅ Added question uniqueness tracking
- ✅ Added progressive depth system (4 levels)
- ✅ Memory Engine still working

### December 24, 2025 - User Reports Failure
**User:** "Memory Engine stopped working after December 24th"
- ❌ AI questions stopped generating
- ❌ Getting default questions instead

### January 13, 2026 - Attempted Fix #1
**Commit:** `e527ddce` "Restore STABLE v0.2.0 cooldown logic"
- Added period-based cooldown (2 questions/day max)
- Introduced `isRecentlyAsked` variable
- Intent: Fix by reverting to known working logic
- ❌ Still not working (quota system blocked)

### January 18, 2026 - Attempted Fix #2  
**Commit:** `75749c43` "Remove period cooldown blocking quota"
- Removed period cooldown system
- **DELETED** `isRecentlyAsked` variable definition
- ⚠️ **LEFT BEHIND** console.log reference to `isRecentlyAsked`
- ❌ Created undefined variable error
- Result: Memory Engine fails silently, falls back to defaults

### January 27, 2026 - ROOT CAUSE FOUND
**Commit:** `a79e3e12` "CRITICAL FIX: Remove undefined variable"
- ✅ Fixed undefined `isRecentlyAsked` reference
- ✅ Memory Engine should now work

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### The Bug
```typescript
// Line 1814 in src/server/routes/api.ts
console.log(`Memory question request:`, {
  userId: req.user.id,
  userEmail: req.user.email,
  userTags: req.user.tags,
  hasUsershipTag,
  isRecentlyAsked,  // ❌ UNDEFINED - variable was deleted Jan 18
})
```

### The Impact
1. **Runtime Error:** JavaScript threw `ReferenceError: isRecentlyAsked is not defined`
2. **Error Caught:** Try-catch block caught the error
3. **Fallback Triggered:** System logged "AI generation failed"
4. **Default Questions:** User got "What matters most to you today?" repeatedly

### Why It Took So Long To Find
- **Dec 24 - Jan 13:** Unknown issue (possibly different)
- **Jan 13 - Jan 18:** Period cooldown limiting to 2 questions/day
- **Jan 18 - Jan 27:** Undefined variable silently failing
- **Diagnostics Misleading:** `/admin-api/memory-debug` bypassed the broken code path

## 🎯 What's Fixed Now

### Commit `a79e3e12` (Deployed Today)
```typescript
// Line 1814 - FIXED
console.log(`Memory question request:`, {
  userId: req.user.id,
  userEmail: req.user.email,
  userTags: req.user.tags,
  hasUsershipTag,
  intelligentPacing: {  // ✅ DEFINED - provides useful diagnostics
    shouldShowPrompt,
    isWeekend,
    promptQuotaToday,
    promptsShownToday
  }
})
```

## ✅ Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before (Broken)
```
User visits site
  ↓
Frontend requests question from /api/memory
  ↓
Server hits line 1814: console.log with undefined isRecentlyAsked
  ↓
ReferenceError thrown
  ↓
Caught by try-catch
  ↓
"AI generation failed" logged
  ↓
Fall back to default questions
  ↓
User sees: "What matters most to you today?" (same question every time)
```

### After (Fixed)
```
User visits site
  ↓
Frontend requests question from /api/memory
  ↓
Server logs diagnostics successfully (line 1814 works)
  ↓
Intelligent pacing check: shouldShowPrompt = true
  ↓
AI engine generates question with full context
  ↓
User sees: "How do you like to move your body to relax and unwind, 
           especially on a warm evening like this in Malibu?"
           (personalized, contextual, unique)
```

## 📊 Verification Steps

1. **Redeploy** site with commit `a79e3e12` or later
2. **Visit** lot-systems.com as Usership user
3. **Check** Memory widget
4. **Expected:** Personalized AI-generated question
5. **Verify:** Different question on each widget appearance

## 🧪 How To Test

### Quick Test
Visit `/admin-api/memory-debug` - should show:
```
✅ SUCCESS! Generated question:
"[Personalized question here]"
Options: 4
```

### Live Test  
Visit homepage and wait for Memory widget:
- ✅ Question should be personalized (mention location, weather, time)
- ✅ Question should be unique (not "What matters most to you today?")
- ✅ Options should be contextual (not generic)

## 🔧 Additional Context

### Intelligent Pacing System (Still Active)
- Weekend: 12-15 questions/day
- Weekday: 10-15 questions/day  
- Day 1: 10 questions (strong start)
- No period restrictions
- 24/7 availability

### AI Engines (All Working)
- ✅ Together.AI (primary)
- ✅ Anthropic Claude (fallback)
- ✅ OpenAI GPT (fallback)

### Memory Engine Modules (All Compiled)
- ✅ question-generator.js (38KB)
- ✅ buildPrompt function (complete with all task instructions)
- ✅ trait-extraction.js (15KB)
- ✅ All 9 modules verified

## 📝 Outstanding Mystery

**Question:** What broke between Dec 23-24?
- Dec 23: Enhancement added, should still work
- Dec 24: User reports it stopped working
- Jan 13: Period cooldown added as "fix"

**Hypothesis:** May have been unrelated issue (deployment, env vars, API keys) that coincided with Dec 24 timing. The undefined variable issue was definitely introduced Jan 18.

**Status:** Current fix (Jan 27) addresses the definite bug. If issues persist after deployment, we can investigate Dec 24 separately.

---

**SUMMARY:** Memory Engine should work now. The undefined variable was blocking all AI generation. Fix deployed in commit `a79e3e12`.
