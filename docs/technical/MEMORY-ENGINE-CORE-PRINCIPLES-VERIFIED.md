## ✅ Core Principle #1: Context-Based Generation

**Status**: VERIFIED ✅

**Implementation** (`memory.ts` - `buildPrompt()` function):

The Memory Engine generates questions based on rich contextual information:

### Weather & Location Context
```typescript
// Lines 275-292
const context = await getLogContext(user)
const localDate = context.timeZone ? dayjs().tz(context.timeZone) : null
const tempC = Math.round(toCelsius(context.temperature))
contextLine = `It is ${localDate} in ${context.city}, ${context.country},
               with a current temperature of ${tempC}℃ and humidity at ${humidity}%.`
```

### Time-Based Context
- Current time of day (morning, midday, evening, night)
- Day of week (weekend vs. weekday)
- Time zone awareness

### Environmental Context
- Current weather conditions
- Temperature and humidity
- Weather description (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.)

**Result**: Questions adapt to user's current environment, time, and conditions.

## ✅ Core Principle #2: Context-Based Follow-Up

**Status**: VERIFIED ✅

**Implementation** (`memory.ts` - lines 386-432):

### Previous Answer Analysis
```typescript
// Extract Memory answers to build user's story
const memoryLogs = logs.filter((log) => log.event === 'answer')

// Extract recently asked questions to avoid duplicates
const recentQuestions = memoryLogs
  .slice(0, 30)
  .map(log => log.metadata.question || '')
  .filter(Boolean)
```

### Strict Duplicate Prevention
```
**STRICT NO-DUPLICATE POLICY:**
🚫 NEVER ask the same question twice - even with different wording
🚫 NEVER ask questions that are too similar to recent questions
🚫 If a topic was covered recently, find a completely NEW angle or topic
```

### Topic Diversity Tracking
```typescript
// Lines 219-260 - extractQuestionTopics()
const topicKeywords = {
  beverage: ['tea', 'coffee', 'drink', ...],
  food: ['food', 'meal', 'eat', ...],
  sleep: ['sleep', 'rest', 'bed', ...],
  movement: ['exercise', 'walk', ...],
  // ... 10 topic categories tracked
}
```

### Natural Follow-Up Flow
- Questions build on previous answers
- Natural progression through topics
- Deepening understanding over time
- Avoids repetition while maintaining coherence

**Result**: Each question follows naturally from the user's Memory Story, building depth over time without repeating.

---

## ✅ Core Principle #3: Usership Tag Only

**Status**: VERIFIED ✅

**Implementation** (`api.ts` - lines 1716-1718, 1805):

### Tag Verification
```typescript
// Check if user has Usership tag for AI-generated questions
const hasUsershipTag = req.user.tags.some(
  (tag) => tag.toLowerCase() === 'usership'
)
```

### Conditional AI Generation
```typescript
if (hasUsershipTag) {
  // Usership users: Generate AI-based context-aware question using Claude
  console.log(`🔍 Attempting to generate AI question for Usership user ${req.user.id}`)

  // Load recent logs for context
  const logs = await fastify.models.Log.findAll({ ... })

  // Build prompt with full context
  const prompt = await buildPrompt(req.user, logs, isWeekend, quantumState)

  // Generate question with AI
  const question = await completeAndExtractQuestion(prompt, req.user)

  return question
}
// Otherwise: fall through to default questions
```

### Non-Usership Fallback
- Users without Usership tag get default question bank
- No AI generation for non-subscribers
- Clear separation between tiers

**Result**: AI-powered contextual questions are exclusive to Usership subscribers.

## ✅ Core Principle #4: Special Attention to User Log Entries

**Status**: VERIFIED ✅

**Implementation** (`api.ts` - lines 1810-1816, `memory.ts` - lines 434-444):

### Comprehensive Log Loading
```typescript
// Load recent logs for context - balanced amount for good context
const logs = await fastify.models.Log.findAll({
  where: { userId: req.user.id },
  order: [['createdAt', 'DESC']],
  limit: 40,  // 40 logs for rich context
})
```

### Journal Entry Analysis
```typescript
// Extract journal entries for deeper persona research
const journalLogs = logs.filter((log) =>
  log.event === 'note' && log.text && log.text.length > 20
)
```

### Memory Answer Extraction
```typescript
// Extract Memory answers to build user's story
const memoryLogs = logs.filter((log) => log.event === 'answer')
console.log(`💬 Extracted ${memoryLogs.length} memory answers from ${logs.length} total logs`)
```

### User Trait Extraction
```typescript
if (memoryLogs.length >= 3) {
  const analysis = extractUserTraits(logs)
  const { traits, patterns, psychologicalDepth } = analysis
  // Uses traits to inform question generation
}
```

### Log Types Analyzed
1. **Memory answers** (`event: 'answer'`) - User's responses to Memory questions
2. **Journal entries** (`event: 'note'`) - Free-form user reflections
3. **Settings changes** - User preferences and behavior
4. **All interactions** - Complete user activity history

**Result**: Deep analysis of user's journal entries, answers, and patterns to generate personalized questions.

## ✅ Core Principle #5: Quantum Intent Engine

**Status**: VERIFIED ✅

**Implementation** (`api.ts` - lines 1818-1834, `memory.ts` - lines 294-325):

### Quantum State Extraction from Client
```typescript
// Extract quantum state from client for context-aware question generation
const validEnergy = ['depleted', 'low', 'moderate', 'high', 'unknown']
const validClarity = ['confused', 'uncertain', 'clear', 'focused', 'unknown']
const validAlignment = ['disconnected', 'searching', 'aligned', 'flowing', 'unknown']
const validNeedsSupport = ['critical', 'moderate', 'low', 'none']

const quantumState = req.query.qe &&
                     validEnergy.includes(req.query.qe as string) &&
                     validClarity.includes(req.query.qc as string) &&
                     validAlignment.includes(req.query.qa as string) &&
                     validNeedsSupport.includes(req.query.qn as string) ? {
  energy: req.query.qe as 'depleted' | 'low' | 'moderate' | 'high' | 'unknown',
  clarity: req.query.qc as 'confused' | 'uncertain' | 'clear' | 'focused' | 'unknown',
  alignment: req.query.qa as 'disconnected' | 'searching' | 'aligned' | 'flowing' | 'unknown',
  needsSupport: req.query.qn as 'critical' | 'moderate' | 'low' | 'none'
} : undefined
```

### Quantum-Aware Question Guidance
```typescript
**Quantum State (Real-time user energy from pattern recognition):**
Their current state: ${quantumState.energy} energy,
                    ${quantumState.clarity} clarity,
                    ${quantumState.alignment} alignment
Support level: ${quantumState.needsSupport}

**Quantum-Aware Question Guidance:**
${quantumState.energy === 'depleted' || quantumState.energy === 'low'
  ? '- User has low energy: Ask gentle, restorative questions about rest, self-care, or small wins'
  : quantumState.energy === 'high'
  ? '- User has high energy: Ask expansive questions about goals, creativity, or meaningful action'
  : '- User has moderate energy: Balanced questions about daily life and growth'}

${quantumState.clarity === 'confused' || quantumState.clarity === 'uncertain'
  ? '- User lacks clarity: Ask grounding questions to help them notice and understand their state'
  : quantumState.clarity === 'focused'
  ? '- User is focused: Ask deeper questions that leverage their current clarity'
  : ''}

${quantumState.alignment === 'disconnected' || quantumState.alignment === 'searching'
  ? '- User feels disconnected: Ask questions about values, intentions, or what matters'
  : quantumState.alignment === 'flowing'
  ? '- User is in flow: Ask questions that celebrate and deepen this aligned state'
  : ''}

Match your question to their quantum state. The engine recognizes patterns they may not consciously see.
```

### Energy-Based Question Adaptation
- **Depleted/Low Energy**: Gentle, restorative questions about rest and self-care
- **Moderate Energy**: Balanced questions about daily life and growth
- **High Energy**: Expansive questions about goals, creativity, meaningful action

### Clarity-Based Question Adaptation
- **Confused/Uncertain**: Grounding questions to help notice and understand
- **Clear**: Standard balanced questions
- **Focused**: Deeper questions leveraging current clarity

### Alignment-Based Question Adaptation
- **Disconnected/Searching**: Questions about values, intentions, what matters
- **Aligned**: Standard questions maintaining alignment
- **Flowing**: Questions that celebrate and deepen aligned state

### Support-Based Question Adaptation
- **Critical/Moderate Support Needed**: Compassionate, supportive questions
- **Low/No Support Needed**: Standard analytical questions

**Result**: Questions dynamically adapt to user's real-time quantum state (energy, clarity, alignment, support needs).

## 🎯 Goal Understanding System

**BONUS**: Goal extraction and journey stage tracking

**Implementation** (`memory.ts` - lines 327-384):

### Active Goal Detection
```typescript
const userGoals = extractGoals(user, logs)
const activeGoals = userGoals.filter(g =>
  g.state === 'active' || g.state === 'progressing'
).slice(0, 3)
```

### Journey Stage Adaptation
Questions adapt to user's journey stage:
- **Beginning**: Foundational questions about WHY and first steps
- **Struggle**: Supportive questions acknowledging difficulty
- **Breakthrough**: Questions celebrating progress and integration
- **Integration**: Questions exploring transformation and wisdom
- **Mastery**: Questions inviting reflection on lessons learned

### Goal Category Focus
Specialized questioning based on goal category:
- **Emotional**: Regulation, mood patterns, triggers, coping, awareness
- **Relational**: Connection quality, boundaries, communication, needs
- **Behavioral**: Habit formation, consistency, routines, accountability
- **Growth**: Self-awareness, values alignment, identity evolution
- **Physical**: Energy levels, sleep, movement, rest, body awareness
- **Creative**: Expression, flow states, inspiration, artistic practice

**Result**: Questions directly support user's active goals and current journey stage.
