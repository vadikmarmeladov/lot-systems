### Key Subsystems

#### 1. Memory Engine
**Purpose:** AI-generated, context-aware questions that build psychological depth over time.

**Technical Implementation:**
```
User Context → Claude API → Personalized Question → Answer → Profile Update
     ↓                                                              ↑
Historical Logs (120 entries) ─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Features:**
- Duplicate detection algorithm (semantic similarity check)
- Quantum state integration (energy, clarity, alignment, needsSupport)
- Weekly summary generation
- Badge unlock notifications
- Retry mechanism with error handling (bulletproofed localStorage operations)

**API Endpoint:** `GET /api/memory?d={base64_date}&qe={energy}&qc={clarity}&qa={alignment}&qn={needsSupport}`

**Performance:**
- 2-5 second question generation latency
- Cached responses with 12-hour TTL
- Graceful degradation on API failures

#### 2. Quantum Intent Engine™
**Purpose:** Multi-dimensional pattern recognition that predicts user needs across all widgets.

**Architecture:**
```
Widget Signals → Signal Recording → Pattern Analysis → Widget Recommendations
     ↓                                      ↓
(mood, planner,                    (7 pattern types)
 memory, journal,                          ↓
 selfcare, intentions)          User State Calculation
                                (energy, clarity, alignment, support needs)
```

**Signal Types:**
- Mood check-ins (8 emotions tracked)
- Planning activities (4 dimensions: intent, today, how, feeling)
- Memory answers (question ID, option, timestamp)
- Self-care completions (practice type, duration)
- Intention setting/completion
- Journal entries

**Pattern Recognition (7 Types):**
1. **Anxiety Pattern** - Multiple anxious moods → Suggest self-care (confidence: 0.66-1.0)
2. **Lack of Structure** - Tired + no planning → Suggest planner (confidence: 0.7)
3. **Seeking Direction** - No intention for weeks → Suggest intentions (confidence: 0.8)
4. **Flow Potential** - Energized + planning → Passive memory prompts (confidence: 0.9)
5. **Evening Overwhelm** - Evening + overwhelmed → Immediate self-care (confidence: 0.85)
6. **Surface Awareness** - Consistent moods + no journaling → Suggest deeper reflection (confidence: 0.6)
7. **Morning Clarity** - Calm morning state → Set intention (confidence: 0.75)

**Technical Specs:**
- Signal retention: 7 days
- Max signals: 1,000 (prevents memory leaks)
- Analysis cooldown: 5 minutes
- localStorage-based persistence with comprehensive error handling

**User State Calculation:**
- **Energy:** depleted/low/moderate/high/unknown (based on mood scoring)
- **Clarity:** confused/uncertain/clear/focused/unknown (based on planning + intentions)
- **Alignment:** disconnected/searching/aligned/flowing (based on positive signals + planning)
- **Needs Support:** none/low/moderate/critical (based on anxiety signal count)

#### 3. Psychological Profiling System
**Purpose:** Dynamic archetype classification and trait extraction from user behavior.

**Data Model:**
```typescript
PsychologicalProfile {
  archetype: string              // "The Builder", "The Healer", etc.
  coreValues: string[]           // ["mindful", "present", "aware"]
  emotionalPatterns: string[]    // ["calm under pressure", "steady"]
  cognitiveStyle: string[]       // ["analytical", "practical"]
  growthTrajectory: string[]     // ["expanding awareness", "building"]
  selfAwarenessLevel: number     // 0-100 (displayed as 0.0-10.0%)
  behavioralCohort: string       // "Morning Reflectors", "Evening Planners"
  streak: number                 // Consecutive days with answers
}
```

**Profile Generation:**
- Uses last 200 user logs for deep context
- Claude Opus 4.5 analysis with structured prompts
- Regenerates on significant behavioral shifts
- Public profiles at `/os/{username}`

**8 Core Archetypes:**
- The Explorer
- The Builder
- The Healer
- The Sage
- The Creator
- The Guardian

- **∘ Droplet** - 7-day streak (milestone_7)
- **≈ Wave** - 30-day streak (milestone_30)
- **≋ Current** - 100-day streak (milestone_100)

**Technical Implementation:**
- localStorage-based with try-catch protection (private browsing safe)
- Race condition locking (prevents multi-tab conflicts)
- Queue system for unlock notifications
- Displayed as "Level:" field in public profiles
- Award check triggered post-Memory answer

**Unlock Messages:**
- "First drops form. ∘"
- "Waves begin to flow. ≈"
- "Deep currents established. ≋"

#### 5. Planner Widget
**Purpose:** Daily/weekly intention-based planning with exploratory interface.

**Four Dimensions:**
1. **Intent:** Deeper purpose (e.g., "growth", "connection", "rest")
2. **Today:** Concrete actions (e.g., "create", "organize", "reflect")
3. **How:** Approach (e.g., "steady", "playful", "focused")
4. **Feeling:** Target state (e.g., "calm", "energized", "balanced")

**Interaction Model:**
- Arrow-key navigation (↑/↓ = dimensions, ←/→ = cycle values)
- Click navigation for mobile
- Contextual timing prompts (morning/afternoon/evening)
- Records signal to Quantum Intent Engine

**UI Styling:**
- Consistent 1px borders (theme-colored)
- Selected: `border-acc` + `bg-acc/10`
- Unselected: `border-acc/20` (always visible)
- Hover: `border-acc/40` + `bg-acc/5`

#### 6. Emotional Check-In Widget
**Purpose:** Contextual mood tracking with time-of-day awareness.

**Mood Options (8):**
- Calm, Peaceful, Energized, Hopeful
- Anxious, Overwhelmed, Tired, Neutral

**Timing Logic:**
- Morning (6-10am): "How are you starting?"
- Midday (10am-5pm): "How's your day?"
- Evening (5pm-10pm): "How was your day?"
- Night (10pm-6am): "How are you feeling?"

**Cooldown:** 3 hours between prompts

**Integration:** Feeds directly into Quantum Intent Engine for pattern analysis

#### 7. Self-Care Moments
**Purpose:** Guided practices for emotional regulation and stress management.

**Practice Types:**
1. **Breathe & Release** - 4-7-8 breathing technique
2. **Body Scan** - Progressive muscle relaxation
3. **Gratitude Pause** - Quick appreciation exercise
4. **Energy Reset** - Movement and grounding
5. **Mindful Check-In** - Present moment awareness

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Quantum Intent Engine detects anxiety/overwhelm patterns
- Key times: mid-morning (10-12), afternoon (2-5), evening (7-10)
- 3-hour cooldown between sessions
- Daily completion tracking

**Completion Flow:**
```
Practice Selection → Guided Instructions → Completion →
Insight Generation (Claude) → 7-second display → Widget dismiss
```

#### 8. Public Profile System
**Purpose:** Shareable psychological profiles with privacy controls.

**URL Structure:** `/os/{username}`

**Profile Components:**
- Username & city
- Archetype
- Level (Aquatic Evolution badge)
- Core values (capitalized with · separators)
- Emotional patterns
- Cognitive style
- Growth trajectory
- Behavioral cohort
- Self-awareness index (0.0-10.0%)

**Styling:**
- Clean two-column layout (label: 170px, content: flex-1)
- Mobile-responsive (adjusts at 640px breakpoint)
- Theme-aware (respects acc/bac colors)

**Privacy:**
- Opt-in system (user controls visibility)
- No sensitive data exposure
- Streak included for Level calculation

#### 9. Theme System
**Modes:**
1. **Light Mode** - High contrast, blue accents
2. **Dark Mode** - Custom accent colors
3. **Mirror Mode** - Inverted, monochrome aesthetic

**Mirror Mode Specs:**
- `bg-white/20` for active elements
- `border-white` for outlines
- `hover:bg-white/10` for interactions
- No solid fills (maintains transparency)

**Custom Themes:**
- CSS variable-based (`--acc-color-*`, `--base-color`)
- User-configurable accent colors (100-900 scale)
- Persistent via localStorage
