## 🔒 Critical Stability Fixes (HIGH Priority)

### Memory Engine Bulletproofing
Applied **12 critical fixes** across 4 core files to prevent crashes and improve reliability:

#### MemoryWidget.tsx
- ✅ Protected all localStorage operations with try-catch blocks
- ✅ Fixed parseInt() to include radix parameter (base 10)
- ✅ Added NaN validation for timestamp parsing
- ✅ Protected getNextBadgeUnlock() call
- ✅ Added setTimeout cleanup in useEffect
- ✅ Fixed quantum state memo dependencies

#### api.ts (Memory API)
- ✅ Protected atob() call to prevent server crashes on invalid base64
- ✅ Return 400 error with helpful message on invalid encoding
- ✅ Added quantum state enum validation (energy, clarity, alignment, needsSupport)
- ✅ Strengthened weekly summary object structure validation

#### intentionEngine.ts
- ✅ Protected localStorage.setItem() with try-catch
- ✅ Added MAX_SIGNALS = 1000 limit to prevent unbounded memory growth
- ✅ Created hasCurrentIntention() helper to safely check localStorage
- ✅ Improved analysis throttling by checking cooldown before triggering

#### badges.ts
- ✅ Protected all 6 localStorage operations with try-catch blocks
- ✅ Added invalid badge ID validation in getNextBadgeUnlock()
- ✅ Implemented locking mechanism to prevent race conditions in awardBadge()
- ✅ Protected response.json() parsing with dedicated try-catch
- ✅ Added stats object validation in checkAndAwardBadges()

**Impact:**
- Prevents crashes in private browsing mode (localStorage disabled)
- Prevents crashes when localStorage quota exceeded
- Prevents server crashes from malformed client requests
- Prevents memory leaks from unbounded signal growth
- Prevents race conditions in multi-tab scenarios
- Validates all external inputs (query params, API responses)

## 🌊 Aquatic Evolution Badge System

Implemented new milestone badge system with water metaphor for growth.

### Design Philosophy
**Progression:** Droplet → Wave → Deep Current

### Badge Tiers
- **∘ Droplet** - 7-day streak (milestone_7) - "First drops form. ∘"
- **≈ Wave** - 30-day streak (milestone_30) - "Waves begin to flow. ≈"
- **≋ Current** - 100-day streak (milestone_100) - "Deep currents established. ≋"

### Implementation Details
- Dedicated "Level:" field in Public Profile (after Self-awareness)
- Badges displayed as separators replaced with `joinWithDots()` (capitalized traits)
- Removed 5 pattern badges (balanced, flow, consistent, reflective, explorer)
- Simplified to milestone-only system for cleaner UX

### Technical Features
- localStorage-based with comprehensive error handling
- Race condition locking (multi-tab safe)
- Queue system for unlock notifications via Memory Widget
- Streak calculation in public-api.ts (lines 786-814)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/client/utils/badges.ts` - Core badge logic
- `src/client/components/PublicProfile.tsx` - Level field display
- `src/server/routes/public-api.ts` - Streak calculation

**Commits:**
- `a77d7d9` - "Implement Aquatic Evolution badge system with Level field"
- `44a2f57` - "Design Level field badge system - cleaner approach"

## 🎨 UI/UX Enhancements

### 1. Planner Frame Styling Fix
**Problem:**
- Frame was disappearing when clicking arrows
- Inconsistent border widths (border-2 vs border)
- Border colors didn't match theme

**Solution:**
- Consistent 1px borders across all states
- Selected: `border-acc` + `bg-acc/10`
- Unselected: `border-acc/20` (always visible)
- Hover: `border-acc/40` + `bg-acc/5`

**Commit:** `ea35e9d` - "Fix Planner frame styling - consistent borders and theme colors"

### 2. Mirror Mode System Button Fix
**Problem:**
- System button had solid white fill in Mirror mode
- Text was inverted due to `mix-blend-difference`
- Didn't match transparent/outlined style of other buttons

**Solution:**
- Changed to transparent with subtle white tint (`bg-white/20`)
- Removed `mix-blend-difference` so text stays properly white
- Hover state brightens (`bg-white/30`)
- Now consistent with other navigation buttons

**Commit:** `04f52ae` - "Fix System button styling in Mirror mode - transparent with subtle tint"

### 3. Memory Widget Improvements
- Added retry button with proper query reset
- Enhanced error handling UI with expandable details
- Fixed reflection prompt styling
- Improved error recovery flow

**Commits:**
- `c0f810f` - "Improve Memory Widget retry and error handling"
- `f802778` - "Fix Memory Widget retry button - reset queries to clear error state"
- `ee9493d` - "Fix Memory Widget reflection prompt styling"
- `1ef5c10` - "Add error details UI to Memory Widget"
