## 🎯 Context-Aware Widgets

### Mood Check-In Widget
- **Smart timing**: Appears during morning (6-12), midday (12-17), and evening (17-22) hours
- **3-hour cooldown**: Prevents repetitive prompts, respects user attention
- **Cross-device sync**: Uses database logs instead of localStorage for consistent experience across PWA and Desktop
- **Proper grammar**: Context-specific questions ("How is your morning?" / "How is your evening?" / "How are you right now?")
- **Full visibility**: Removed opacity for clearer readability
- **Auto-logging**: All mood check-ins automatically saved to Log with emotional state and insights
- **Compassionate AI responses**: Backend generates personalized, empathetic responses based on emotional state
- **View cycling**: Check-In → History (last 5) → Patterns (stats)

### Self-care Moments Widget
- **Context-aware suggestions**: Adapts based on weather, archetype, dominant mood, and time of day
- **Interactive timer**: Start practice with countdown for timed activities
- **Daily tracking**: Tracks completions with localStorage, shows "X done today"
- **Three actions**: Start (with timer), Done (mark complete), Skip (get new suggestion)
- **Auto-logging**: Logs both completions and skips to track self-care patterns
- **Smart recommendations**:
  - **Weather-based**: Rain → cozy moments, Sun → outdoor time
  - **Mood-based**: Anxious → breathing exercises, Tired → power rest, Grateful → journaling
  - **Archetype-based**: Seeker → reflective inquiry, Nurturer → self-nurture, Creator → free expression
  - **Time-based**: Morning → intention-setting, Evening → closing rituals
- **Gentle completion messages**: "Well done.", "Complete.", "Done.", "Finished."
- **Consistent styling**: Buttons match LOT design, proper spacing and transparency
- **View cycling**: Suggestion → Why This → Practice

## 📊 Long-term Awareness Tracking

### Redesigned Self-Awareness Index
- **Decimal precision**: 0-10% scale with one decimal place (e.g., 2.3%, 5.7%)
- **Four-component algorithm** (max 100 points → display as 0-10%):
  - **Volume** (40 pts): `Math.min(40, Math.sqrt(totalLogs) * 4)` - Rewards engagement
  - **Quality** (30 pts): `(reflectiveScore / totalLogs) * 30` - Rewards depth
  - **Consistency** (15 pts): `Math.min(15, (totalLogs / daysSinceStart) * 100)` - Rewards regularity
  - **Depth** (15 pts): `Math.min(15, journalEntries * 1.5)` - Rewards long-form writing
- **Long-term growth**: Designed for gradual progression over months/years (20% → 2% makes reaching 10% a significant achievement)
- **Standardized display**: Consistent `(value / 10).toFixed(1) + '%'` format across:
  - Astrology > Psychology view
  - Memory milestone insights
  - Public Profile page

## ✨ UX Enhancements

### Log Save Animation
- **Two gentle breathe blinks**: Smooth opacity transition (35% ↔ 75%)
- **Fluid easing**: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.6, 1)` for natural breathing rhythm
- **Fixed 4-second cycle**: 2 iterations × 2s each, then push to server
- **Reliable timing**: Removed complex state tracking for consistent behavior
- **CSS implementation**:
  ```css
  @keyframes blink {
    0% { opacity: 0.35; }
    50% { opacity: 0.75; }
    100% { opacity: 0.35; }
  }
  .animate-blink {
    animation: blink 2s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.6, 1);
    animation-iteration-count: 2;
  }
  ```

### Widget Fade-outs
- **Gentle exits**: 3-second display, then 1.4-second fade to 0% opacity
- **Non-intrusive**: Widgets gracefully disappear after interaction
- **Applies to**: Mood check-in responses, Self-care completion messages

### Subscribe Widget
- **Simple call-to-action**: Links to `brand.lot-systems.com`
- **Two tiers**: R&D $15, Usership $99
- **Smart frequency control**:
  - Minimum 10 answer logs (engaged users only)
  - No existing subscription tags (Usership or R&D)
  - 10-day cooldown after click
  - 20% random probability when eligible
- **One-click dismiss**: Stores timestamp, won't show again for 10 days
- **New tab behavior**: Opens subscription page without interrupting LOT session

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Cross-Device & Sync Issues
- **Mood widget sync**: Fixed appearing on Desktop after answering on PWA
  - Changed from `localStorage.getItem('last-mood-checkin-time')` to database logs
  - Check: `logs.filter(log => log.event === 'emotional_checkin')[0]`
  - Ensures consistent 3-hour cooldown across all devices
- **Sync message likes**: Fixed persistence across tab navigation
  - Added `queryClient.invalidateQueries(['/api/chat-messages'])` after like
  - Reset `hasInitiallyLoaded.current` on component unmount
- **Theme synchronization**: Custom themes now sync between PWA and Desktop

### PWA & Loading
- **Profile loading crash**: Fixed PWA startup issues with aggressive profile caching
  - Disabled problematic cache optimization
  - Forced React Query refresh for critical data
- **Force cache refresh**: Service worker version bumps for awareness display updates
- **Connection banner**: Redesigned to match LOT style with timestamp and version info

### Radio Widget
- **Dependency cycle fix**: Eliminated crash from circular imports between stores
- **Playback countdown timer**: Shows time remaining for current track
- **Error handling**: Better initial state messaging ("Loading..." vs error states)
- **Desktop stability**: Prevented reloading issues during audio playback

### UI Consistency
- **Log type field**: Fixed transparency during typing (consistent opacity)
- **Private profile mode**: Redesigned to match LOT aesthetic
- **Spacing standardization**: Consistent `mb-16` spacing across all widgets
- **Button transparency**: Self-care Skip button now matches Start/Done (removed `opacity-60`)

## 🔒 Security
- **Removed .env files**: Sensitive environment files removed from git tracking
  - `.env`, `credentials.json` patterns in `.gitignore`
  - Warning system in commit workflow to prevent accidental commits

## 📝 Technical Improvements

### Backend Enhancements
- **Emotional check-in API** (`POST /api/emotional-check-ins`):
  - Stores: `checkInType`, `emotionalState`, `intensity`, `note`, `insights`
  - Generates compassionate AI responses using psychological depth data
  - Creates Log entries with formatted text: "Feeling [state] [timeOfDay]"
  - Returns personalized insights based on user's archetype and patterns

- **Psychological depth analysis**:
  - 5 metrics: Reflective, Emotionally Aware, Action-Oriented, Analytical, Creative
  - Pattern tracking across all user logs
  - Growth trajectory calculation
  - Self-awareness index with 4-component algorithm

- **Log metadata structure**:
  ```typescript
  {
    event: 'emotional_checkin' | 'self_care_completed' | 'self_care_skipped',
    metadata: {
      emotionalState?: string,
      intensity?: number,
      note?: string,
      insights?: string[],
      action?: string,
      duration?: string
    }
  }
  ```

### Frontend Architecture
- **Clickable label cycling pattern**: Consistent across all widgets
  - Click label to cycle through views
  - State management with React hooks
  - Smooth view transitions

- **Context-aware rendering**: IIFE patterns in JSX for conditional widget display
  ```tsx
  {(() => {
    const hour = new Date().getHours()
    const isMorning = hour >= 6 && hour < 12
    // ... context checks
    return condition && <Widget />
  })()}
  ```

- **Fade-out animations**: Reusable pattern with state management
  ```tsx
  const [isFading, setIsFading] = useState(false)
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(true)

  setTimeout(() => setIsFading(true), 3000)
  setTimeout(() => setIsVisible(false), 4400)

  <div className={cn(
    'transition-opacity duration-[1400ms]',
    isFading ? 'opacity-0' : 'opacity-100'
  )}>
  ```
