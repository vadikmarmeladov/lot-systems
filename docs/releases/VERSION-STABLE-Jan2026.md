## 🎨 Established LOT Design Principles

Through this release, we've codified the core LOT design philosophy:

1. **Minimalist First**: Less is more. Remove before adding.
2. **Context Over Notifications**: Smart timing beats aggressive prompting.
3. **Database Over localStorage**: Cross-device sync is non-negotiable.
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Fade out, don't snap away.
5. **User Agency**: Suggest, don't command.
6. **Long-term Growth**: Months and years, not days and weeks.
7. **Technical Accuracy**: Truth over validation.
8. **Consistent Voice**: Direct, concise, respectful.
