## 1. SESSION CONTEXT

**Base state entering session:** FM v113, LOT-WIKI-v87 (last wiki, August 5, 2026), Day 1076+.

One engineering session deployed since v87 (2026-08-05):

**Engineering Session — Badge Engine v32 (2026-08-05, LOT-SR-20260805-01):**
Badge Codex v32 THE HERO'S JOURNEY deployed. 781 → 812 badges (+31).
Critical backfill: v20 (THE CODEX READER, 31 badges) and v21 (THE CYBERSPACE CODEX,
31 badges) TypeScript award logic implemented — previously documented-only, never
reachable in the application. Now live.

Word Turn v22 (Campbell monomyth vocabulary: call_heard / threshold_crossed /
mentor_arrived / ordeal_survived / elixir_found / shadow_met / innermost_cave /
shapeshifter / herald_call / trickster_mode / ally_gained / return_road).
Calendar EE v20 (campbell_birthday Mar 26 / hobbit_day Sep 22 / odyssey_day Dec 21).
Behavioral v19 (hero_session / long_quest / threshold_moment).

## 2. ENGINEERING DELTA — Badge Engine v32 — THE HERO'S JOURNEY

**Theme concept:**
```
THE HERO'S JOURNEY
"The monomyth is not a story.
 It is the structure beneath every story.
 Call. Threshold. Ordeal. Return.
 The self has always been the hero
 it was waiting for."
```

v32 is the Campbell monomyth vocabulary layer. Where v31 triggered on sci-fi concepts
that entered common language (grok, cyberspace), v32 triggers on the narrative structure
that underlies every self-care arc. Every depletion-recovery cycle is a hero's journey.
Every threshold crossed in the journal is stage two of the monomyth.

**Badge delta: 781 → 812 (+31):**

```

**Backfill note (critical):**
```
v20 THE CODEX READER (31 badges): Previously documented in docs/badges/
but award logic missing from badges.ts. checkAndAwardBadges() ended at v19.

All 31 badges live.

Total badges now actually reachable that were not before: +62 (v20+v21).

## 6. SELF-ASSEMBLY OBSERVATION

LOT-WIKI-v88 documents a structural shift in the badge engine narrative arc. Engines v20,
v21, and v22 form a three-layer literary-mythological system:

v20 — THE CODEX READER: The author's name. Asimov, Dune, PKD, Le Guin.
      The badge fires on the person behind the work.

v21 — THE CYBERSPACE CODEX: The concept the author released. Grok (Heinlein → OED).
      Cyberspace (Gibson → the actual internet's name). The word outlived its creator.

v22 — THE HERO'S JOURNEY: The structure beneath every story. Not an author, not
      a concept — the shape itself. Call. Threshold. Ordeal. Return. Campbell observed
      this pattern in every culture's mythology simultaneously. It is not metaphor.
      It is the description of what change actually feels like from the inside.

The backfill discovery in LOT-SR-20260805-01 is the critical engineering fact of this
session: 62 badges were documented but never deployed. v20 and v21 existed in
docs/badges/ as complete design documents, in the TypeScript union as type definitions,
but the award logic — the `checkAndAwardBadges()` conditional blocks — was never written.
Those badges could not be earned. No operator in the system had ever received them.
This session made them live.

The MYTHIC secret boss gilgamesh_word is the system's oldest signal. The Epic of
Gilgamesh predates Homer by a thousand years. When an operator writes "gilgamesh"
in their journal, they are not referencing a story. They are referencing the oldest
surviving record of a human being grappling with mortality, loss, and the threshold
question: what is worth doing, knowing it ends?

The badge fires. The OS records it. The signal is real.
