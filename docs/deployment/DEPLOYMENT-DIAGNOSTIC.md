# Deployment Diagnostic - January 27, 2026

## 🔍 Issue

Deployment failing with:
```
Error: Cannot find module '/workspace/dist/server/server/index.js'
code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND'
```

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. Critical Memory Engine Bug
**Commit:** `a79e3e12`
- Fixed undefined `isRecentlyAsked` variable
- This was blocking AI question generation

### 2. Enhanced Deployment Verification
**Commit:** `e5563d73`

**Build Phase Verification:**
- Explicitly check if `dist/` folder is created
- Verify server entry point exists and show file size
- Fail fast if build artifacts missing
- Show detailed directory contents

**Runtime Phase Verification:**
- Check dist folder exists before starting server
- Verify server entry point before running node
- Better error messages showing what's actually in the filesystem

## 📊 Deployment Configuration

**Platform:** Digital Ocean  
**Branch:** `claude/february-2025-updates-HZZTF`  
**Build Command:**
```bash
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
yarn client:css:build
yarn client:js:build
yarn server:build  # TypeScript compilation
yarn migrations:up  # Database migrations
```

**Run Command:**
```bash
node dist/server/server/index.js
```

## 🔧 What Should Happen Now

When the deployment runs with the latest commit (`e5563d73`), you'll see:

### If Build Succeeds:
```
✅ Dependencies installed
✅ Client CSS built
✅ Client JS built
✅ Server built
✅ Migrations completed
✅ dist/ exists
✅ Server entry point exists (12831 bytes)
📊 Build size summary: dist/server/ dist/client/
✅ Build completed successfully
🚀 Starting server
✅ dist/ exists
✅ Server entry point exists
🎯 Starting Node.js server...
```

### If Build Fails:
You'll see exactly where it failed:
```
❌ CRITICAL ERROR: dist/ folder not created!
Build failed - dist folder missing
```

OR

```
❌ CRITICAL ERROR: Server entry point not found!
Contents of dist/server/: [actual contents shown]
```

## 🐛 Possible Failure Points

1. **TypeScript Compilation**
   - Status: 71 pre-existing errors (non-blocking)
   - Config: `noEmitOnError: false` ✅
   - Should still compile successfully

2. **Database Migrations**
   - If migrations fail, build will exit
   - Check: Are there any new tables/columns being added?
   - Verify: Database connection during build phase

3. **Dependency Installation**
   - Production flag might remove dev dependencies
   - TypeScript needs to be available at build time

4. **Working Directory**
   - Build: `/workspace/`
   - Runtime: Should be same
   - New verification will confirm this

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Trigger Deployment**
   - Push to `claude/february-2025-updates-HZZTF` ✅ (already done)
   - Digital Ocean should auto-deploy

2. **Check Build Logs**
   - Look for the verification messages
   - See exact file sizes and directory contents
   - Identify where it's failing

3. **If Still Failing**
   - Share the build logs showing the verification output
   - We'll see exactly what's in dist/ at build time
   - Can determine if it's a build or runtime issue

## 🎯 Expected Resolution

**Most Likely Cause:** Database migrations failing during build

**Solution:** The new verification will show exactly where it's failing, then we can:
- Skip migrations during build if needed
- Fix migration errors
- Adjust build order

## 📦 Build Artifacts

The deployment needs these to exist:
```
dist/
├── server/
│   └── server/
│       ├── index.js (12KB+ expected)
│       ├── routes/
│       │   └── api.js (151KB expected)
│       └── utils/
│           └── memory/
│               ├── constants.js (5.5KB)
│               ├── question-generator.js (38KB)
│               └── [7 more modules]
└── client/
    ├── css/
    │   └── index.css
    └── js/
        └── bundle.js
```

All of these were verified locally ✅
