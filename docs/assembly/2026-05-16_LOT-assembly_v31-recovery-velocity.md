## Feedback Signal Extracted

Source: USERSHIP_TRANSMISSION v30 (explicit next-target declaration):

> "Next: Pattern 48 — recovery-velocity (self-care + positive mood shift within 4h, rate of recovery acceleration)."

The system named its own next step. The target was explicit, named, and waiting. No journal text from user was available — the transmission itself is the authoritative directive. This session executed it.

## Delta Analysis — Ranked Build List

| Priority | Target | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1** | Pattern 48 (recovery-velocity) | Explicit USERSHIP_TRANSMISSION directive from v30 |
| P2 | Pattern 49 (care-momentum: 2+ self-care in 24h without depleting mood) | Named in this session's USERSHIP_TRANSMISSION as next |
| P3 | About.tsx wiki update — v31 phase entry, P48 vocabulary | Documentation pass |
| P4 | Archetype 16 (Recovery Specialist: selfcare/journal dominant, high P48/P12) | Not named by user; deferred |

Only P1 executed this session, per protocol.

## What Was Built

### `src/client/stores/intentionEngine.ts`
- **Pattern 48 (recovery-velocity)** inserted after Pattern 47 (line ~1140)
- Detection: self-care signal in 4h window + preceding negative mood (anxious/overwhelmed/tired/exhausted within 8h before self-care) + following positive mood (calm/peaceful/energized/hopeful/content after self-care)
- Velocity score: `Math.max(0, 1 - recoveryWindowMin / 240)` — scales with how fast the shift happened
- Confidence: `0.60 + velocityScore * 0.28`, capped at 0.88
- Reason phrase: verbatim mood arc — `"Biofield arc complete: {preMood} → self-care → {postMood}. Recovery window: {N}m. Restored state — capture now while it's fresh."`
- suggestedWidget: `'memory'`, suggestedTiming: `'passive'`
- Explicit distinction from P12 (recovery-window) documented in comment block

### `src/client/components/Logs.tsx`
- **RECV: handler** added after TCOH block (line ~1492)
- Fires on `log.event === 'recovery_velocity'`
- Displays: Mood arc (pre → post), Recovery window (minutes), Self-care 4h count, Confidence
- Chain label: `"Negative mood → self-care → positive shift within 4h"`
- Format consistent with DWRK/SOCR/RLSE/TCOH military log blocks

### `src/client/components/PatternRecognitionWidget.tsx`
- Name map entry: `'recovery-velocity': 'Recovery arc accelerating'`
- QOS Trend view: `"Recovery arc accelerating."` indicator, surfaces when `patterns.some(p => p.pattern === 'recovery-velocity')`

### `src/client/stores/selfAssembly.ts`
- SIGNAL_MAP: `'recovery-velocity': 'selfcare'` and `'recovery_velocity': 'selfcare'`
- Routes P48 detection to the Cleanness Protocol (selfcare) assembly module

### `src/client/components/SystemProgressWidget.tsx`
- SESSION_REPORTS: v31 entry appended (date: 2026-05-16)
- USERSHIP_TRANSMISSION: updated to v31 — 48 patterns, 15 archetypes, 15 modules

## Test Results

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| TypeScript compile (`tsc --noEmit`) | PASS — no new errors (pre-existing environment errors: missing type defs, deprecated node10 resolution, identical to prior sessions) |
| Pattern 48 in intentionEngine.ts | PASS — grep confirmed 48 pattern entries, P48 inserted at correct position after P47, before `calculateUserState()` |
| RECV: handler in Logs.tsx | PASS — `log.event === 'recovery_velocity'` handler confirmed present |
| PatternRecognitionWidget name map | PASS — `'recovery-velocity': 'Recovery arc accelerating'` confirmed at line 96 |
| PatternRecognitionWidget QOS Trend indicator | PASS — `patterns.some(p => p.pattern === 'recovery-velocity')` confirmed at line 295 |
| selfAssembly SIGNAL_MAP | PASS — both hyphenated and underscore variants confirmed at lines 161–162 |
| SystemProgressWidget v31 report | PASS — session report and USERSHIP_TRANSMISSION both updated |
| Style law compliance | PASS — no gradients, no icons, no decorative symbols in changed code |
| Pattern 47 (intention-decay) still present | PASS — regression confirmed, line 1132 |
| Pattern count | PASS — `grep -c "pattern: '"` returns 48 |
| Git commit | PASS — 5 files changed, 119 insertions, 11 deletions |

## What Was Deferred

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Pattern 49 (care-momentum) | Named in this session's USERSHIP_TRANSMISSION as next target; not built because P1 was in scope |
| About.tsx wiki update (v31 phase entry) | Documentation pass; deferred as P3 |
| Archetype 16 (Recovery Specialist) | Not named by user; deferred as P4 |

## Next Session Recommendation

Build Pattern 49 — care-momentum: two or more self-care events within 24h without depleting mood signals present. The proactive care spiral — self-maintenance as habit, not reaction. Structural inverse of cleanness-neglect (P8) and distinct from P48 (which requires a negative state to recover from).
