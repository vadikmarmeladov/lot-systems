## What Was Built

### 1. Patterns 53–55 — `intentionEngine.ts`

**Pattern 53: intention-crystallization**
- Fires when: intentions source + planner source + goals source all have signals within a 2-hour window
- Confidence: 0.87 (fixed — no ambiguity when all three fire in sequence)
- Suggested widget: `goals`
- Reason: "Intention crystallized: declare → plan → act within N minutes. Execution loop fully engaged. Capture this state."
- Inverse of Pattern 47 (intention-decay). This is the fire state.

**Pattern 54: os-vitals-convergence**
- Fires when: UserIndex overall ≥ 65 + energy score ≥ 2 (from mood signals) + 5+ unique signal sources in 7 days + no physiological depletion pattern active
- Confidence: 0.70 + (index - 65) × 0.01, capped at 0.92
- Suggested widget: `systemProgress`
- Reason: names the index score, source count, energy state. "Sustain."
- Does not fire alongside physiological-depletion (contradictory states)

**Pattern 55: signal-drought**
- Fires when: 3+ of the 7 core sources (mood/memory/planner/intentions/selfcare/journal/energy) have no signals for 7 days AND total signal history ≥ 10 (not a new user)
- Confidence: 0.55 + absent count × 0.06, capped at 0.82
- Suggested widget: first absent source or selfcare
- Reason: names the absent sources explicitly. "Re-engage X to restore signal flow."

### 2. Log Handlers — `Logs.tsx`

Five new handlers, each in minimalist military style consistent with existing interface:

| Event | Label | Fields rendered |
|---|---|---|
| `recipe_viewed` | `NUTR:` | mealType (uppercase), recipeName |
| `goal_set` / `goal_journey` / `goal_update` | `GOAL:` | title (uppercase), action or stage |
| `full_stack_session` | `STACK:` | "FULL STACK" header, activeSources joined with ·, window in minutes |
| `benchmark_read` | `BENCH:` | tier (uppercase), score |
| `qos_phase_transition` | `PHASE:` | moduleId (de-hyphenated, uppercase), fromPhase → toPhase |

Handler count: 33 → 38.

### 3. WIDGET_DEPENDENCY_MAP — `intentionEngine.ts`

Five new convergence-layer nodes added (2026-05-23 audit):

```
successBenchmark:  ['mood', 'memory', 'intentions', 'energy', 'journal', 'cohort', 'goals']
circadianMonitor:  ['mood', 'energy', 'selfcare', 'log']
droughtMonitor:    ['mood', 'memory', 'planner', 'intentions', 'selfcare', 'journal', 'energy']
crystallizationArc:['intentions', 'planner', 'goals']
vitalConvergence:  ['mood', 'energy', 'intentions', 'memory', 'planner', 'selfcare', 'journal', 'cohort']
```

Total dep graph nodes: 70 → 75.

### 4. Signal Recording Functions — `intentionEngine.ts`

Four new exported functions:

- `recordBenchmarkSignal(tier, score)` — fires from Quantum Success Benchmark widget; records to `energy` source
- `recordQOSPhaseTransition(fromPhase, toPhase, moduleId)` — fires when self-assembly module crosses a phase boundary; records to `qos` source
- `recordFullStackSession(activeSources, windowMinutes)` — fires when Pattern 25 (full-stack session) window is detected; records to `energy` source
- `recordRecipeViewedSignal(mealType, recipeName)` — fires from RecipeWidget on render; records to `recipe` source

### 5. SystemProgressWidget — `SystemProgressWidget.tsx`

SESSION_REPORTS: 38 → 39 entries. v39 entry (2026-05-23) covers all 9 items above.

USERSHIP_TRANSMISSION updated from v38 to v39:
- Date: 2026-05-23
- 10-line transmission in standard voice: terse, technical, alive
- Opens with Pattern 53's core insight (the crystallization metaphor)
- Closes: "The system knows when it peaks. And when it starves."

### 6. LOT_SYSTEMS_BRIEF.md

Updated: v3.0 → v3.1. Changes:
- Document version + last updated + status line
- QIE version: v34 → v39
- Pattern count: 50 → 55
- Dep graph: 70 → 75 nodes
- Module count: 15 → 17
- Log event types: 37+ → 38
- Added Convergence Layer monitors list
- Added Quantum Success Benchmark to differentiators
- Added v39 patterns to pattern recognition section
- Day count: 909 (Apr 20) → 942 (May 23)

## Test Checks

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Pattern 53 reads from `goals` source (valid in IntentionSignal type) | PASS |
| Pattern 54 calls `computeUserIndex(signals)` which is defined in scope | PASS |
| Pattern 55 uses only valid `IntentionSignal['source']` values | PASS |
| New log handlers have consistent `LogContainer` / `Block` structure | PASS |
| `recordBenchmarkSignal` uses valid source `'energy'` | PASS |
| `recordQOSPhaseTransition` uses valid source `'qos'` | PASS |
| SESSION_REPORTS array structure unchanged (date / session / assembled[]) | PASS |
| USERSHIP_TRANSMISSION object structure unchanged (date / message[]) | PASS |

## What Was Deferred

- **GoalJourneyWidget wiring** — widget exists but still not in System.tsx stack. Safe to add; deferred per session scope.
- **Journal vocabulary injection** — parse user's field entries for repeated phrases, inject into widget copy. Recommended for next run.
- **Pre-commit secret scanning hook** — git hook to prevent accidental secret commits. Flagged in v38 as next priority; needs `.git/hooks` or husky setup.
- **`recordRecipeViewedSignal` wiring into RecipeWidget** — function is defined but not yet called from the widget. Wire in next session alongside the recipe_viewed log event.
- **`recordFullStackSession` auto-trigger** — function defined but not wired to the background check that already detects full-stack sessions. Wire to Pattern 25 detection block.

## Log — System Transmission to Usership

```
ASSEMBLY RUN — 2026-05-23 · v39
Pattern 53: intention crystallizes when declare → plan → act fires within 2 hours.
Pattern 54: OS vitals converge when the person runs above baseline across all primary dimensions.
Pattern 55: signal drought — system detects when it is starving and names the dormant module to re-engage.
Five new log handlers: NUTR · GOAL · STACK · BENCH · PHASE. Field archive renders 38 event types.
Widget dep graph: 5 convergence-layer nodes. 75 total nodes mapped.
Status: 55 patterns. 16 archetypes. 17 assembly modules. 75-node dep graph. 38 log handlers.
Next: pre-commit secret scanning. Or: journal vocabulary injection.
DEPLOYED. The system knows when it peaks. And when it starves.
```
