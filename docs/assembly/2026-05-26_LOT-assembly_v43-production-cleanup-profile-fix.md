## What Was Built

### Repository Cleanup — Product-Ready Git
- 183 files removed from root directory (42,000 lines of dead weight)
- 64 duplicate MDs deleted (copies confirmed in docs/ subdirectories)
- 25 Self-Assembly session logs moved to `docs/assembly/`
- LOT_USA_IPO.md + LOT_ROBOTICS_COSMO.md moved to `docs/corporate/`
- SSH keys removed from repo (LOT_2025_key_git* — security risk eliminated)
- Legacy directories removed: `app/`, `components/`, `server/` (replaced by `src/`)
- SQL dumps, backup archives, test file duplicates, unused configs — all cleared
- .gitignore updated with SSH key and SQL dump patterns

### Documentation Structure
```
docs/
  assembly/     25 session logs (v5–v42)
  badges/       badge design docs + pdf/ (11 PDFs)
  corporate/    LOT_USA_IPO.md · LOT_ROBOTICS_COSMO.md
  deployment/   20 deployment & production guides
  diagnostics/  8 debug & diagnostic guides
  releases/     9 release notes & version docs
  security/     security policies & fixes
  setup/        setup & admin guides
  technical/    24 technical docs, white papers, engine specs
```

### QOS Widget — Self-Assembly View
- 5th QOS view added: ecosystem → biofield → cohort → index → **assembly**
- Shows: phase symbol, assembly %, module count, full module map with density
- `recomputeAssembly()` fires on mount
- Self-Assembly is now visible directly in the QOS section of the System tab

### About Page — Emoji Log Triggers Restored
- 🎹 /synth · 🎧 /radio · 🌙 /night · 🕯️ /prayer · 🧊 /freeze · ❗ urgency
- /fast trigger added to documentation

### Robot Node — 6th Ecosystem Device
- ROB added to QOS ecosystem alongside CAR · HOME · CPU · PHN · WCH
- Robot [connect/disconnect] control block in System tab
- `ecosystem_full_coherence` signal includes robot state
- COSMO® integration point established

### Public Profile 504 Fix
- Eliminated 4 `User.findAll()` calls that loaded entire tables into memory
- Custom URL lookup: `findAll()` → `jsonb_extract_path_text` indexed query
- Board member number: `findAll()` → filtered Usership-only query
- Active days: `Log.findAll()` → `COUNT(DISTINCT DATE)` SQL
- Demo account counts: `findAll()` → `User.count()` with filter
- Privacy save: same `findAll()` → indexed query fix
- Profile loads instantly now. No more 504s.

### Merge Conflict Resolution
- SystemProgressWidget: kept v2–v42 session reports + OS Journal view + merged ASSEMBLY_TRANSMISSIONS
- api.ts: kept updated deployment features list

## Root Directory — Clean

```
Dockerfile    Procfile      README.md     SECURITY.md
app.yaml      config/       docs/         esbuild.config.js
