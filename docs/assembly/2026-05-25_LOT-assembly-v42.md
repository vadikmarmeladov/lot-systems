# LOT Self-Assembly Log

**Date:** 2026-05-25
**Session:** v42
**Branch:** claude/quantum-engine-widgets-RgFfC
**Run type:** Full (ASSEMBLE + LOG REFINEMENT + BACKGROUND JOB + REPORT)

---

## Directive

> Upgrade the Quantum Intent Engine. Look for widget dependencies. Look for Log-based dependencies. Continue building background features. Carefully update the Log feature in minimalist / military style. Look for physiological cohorts and report through the System widgets. Continue develop person's Quantum Operating System. Read through .MDs and develop the company and the site further. Create a self-assembly report with a date after the session to "System progress:" widget.

## What Was Built

### 1. Three New QIE Patterns (56–58)

**Pattern 56: circadian-anchor** (`intentionEngine.ts`)

Detects stable daily rhythm from log signal timestamps.

- Groups signals into 2-hour buckets across a 7-day window
- Tracks unique active days per bucket
- Fires when any bucket covers 5+ consecutive days
- Confidence: `0.60 + (anchorDays - 5) × 0.05`, capped at 0.88
- Suggested widget: `memory` (passive)
- Reason: "Circadian anchor detected: MORNING session (N days). Rhythm established. Deepening this window maximizes signal quality."

**Pattern 57: intention-completion-arc** (`intentionEngine.ts`)

Detects the full intention → plan → care cycle within 7 days.

- Looks for `intentions` source signals in last 7 days
- Cross-references with `planner` and `selfcare` signals in same window
- Arc strength = sum of the three source signal counts (capped at 9)
- Confidence: `0.65 + arcStrength × 0.03`, capped at 0.90
- Suggested widget: `memory` (soon)
- Reason: "Intention → plan → care arc complete within 7 days. Anchor it in memory before it fades."

**Pattern 58: selfcare-saturation** (`intentionEngine.ts`)

Detects over-engagement with self-care practices.

- Counts `selfcare` source signals in last 48 hours
- Fires when count ≥ 5
- Confidence: `0.60 + (count - 5) × 0.04`, capped at 0.80
- Suggested widget: `journal` (next-session)
- Reason: "Self-care saturation: N care actions in 48h. Shift from doing to reflecting."

**Pattern count: 55 → 58**

---

### 2. Log Handlers 39–41 (`Logs.tsx`)

Three new log event handlers added. Military/minimalist style consistent with existing handlers.

**Handler 39 — AUTH:** (`user_login`, `user_logout`)
```
AUTH:
SESSION OPENED
```
or
```
AUTH:
SESSION CLOSED
```
Terse. No metadata noise. The event is the signal.

**Handler 40 — ENV:** (`weather_update`)
```
ENV:
AMSTERDAM
12°C · overcast clouds
```
Shows city in uppercase + temperature + description. Returns null if no city or temp.

**Handler 41 — UI:** (`theme_change`)
```
UI:
THM dark
```
Shows the theme name applied. One line.

**Log handler count: 38 → 41**

---

### 3. Background Job 7 — Weekly Intention Completion Audit (`scheduled-jobs.ts`)

**Job name:** `weekly-intention-completion-audit`
**Schedule:** Sundays at 20:00 UTC (hour === 20 added to scheduler check)
**Scope:** Active users (seen in last 7 days), up to 500

**Logic:**
1. Fetch all `intention`, `plan_set`, `self_care_complete` logs from last 14 days
2. For each intention_set event: check if plan_set OR self_care_complete follows within +7 days
3. Classify each intention as: completed arc (plan + care), partial (either), open (neither)
4. Log aggregate completion rate to console

**Output example:**
```
Total intentions (14d): 47
Completed arcs (intent→plan+care): 23 (49%)
Partial arcs: 12
Open arcs: 12
```

**No individual data persisted.** System monitoring and product insight only.

**Background job count: 6 → 7**

---

### 4. Session Report v42 (`SystemProgressWidget.tsx`)

SESSION_REPORTS v42 entry appended.
USERSHIP_TRANSMISSION updated from v39 date to v42 (2026-05-25).

The transmission reads:
> Three new patterns. 56: the system detects your daily rhythm — same hour, five days running.
> 57: the intention arc completes when you declare, plan, and act within a week.
> 58: self-care saturation — five care actions in 48 hours means something is driving this. Reflect.

## Widget Dependency Audit

All dependency paths verified against current system state:

| Widget | Key Deps | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| `systemProgress` | mood, memory, planner, intentions, selfcare, journal, energy, cohort, log, calculator | Current |
| `system` | + qos | Current |
| `quantumEngine` | mood, energy, intentions, cohort | Current |
| `cohortConnect` | cohort, mood, memory, journal, selfcare, intentions | Current |
| `narrative` | mood, memory, journal, intentions | Current |
| `evolution` | mood, memory, planner, intentions, selfcare, journal, energy | Current |
| `chakra` | mood, energy, selfcare, journal | Current |
| `qosSnapshot` | mood, energy, intentions, selfcare, memory, planner, cohort | Current |

**WIDGET_DEPENDENCY_MAP**: No new nodes required. Existing 75+ node graph accurate.

## Physiological Cohort Reporting Surface

Two active paths for physiological cohort data:

1. **CohortConnectWidget** — `Cohort:` block. Shows: Archetype, Cohort name, ATP level, energy trajectory. Source: `/api/profile`.
2. **QuantumEngineWidgets** — QOS `Cohort:` view. Shows: Archetype, Cohort, Readiness%, Priority need. Source: `/api/user-profile` + physiological report.
3. **SystemProgressWidget** — `Self-Assembly:` view. Shows: Archetype, Cohort, Biofield ATP. Source: `/api/cohorts`.
4. **SystemProgressWidget** — `System Report:` view. Shows: Physiological cohort section. Source: `getPhysiologicalReport()`.

All four paths active and verified.

## Next Session Candidates

- **Journal vocabulary extraction** — extract recurring words/phrases from user notes, inject into widget copy and prompt templates
- **Pre-commit secret scanning hook** — prevent future secret exposure via git hooks
- **Pattern 59: longitudinal-drift** — detect when UserIndex declines for 3+ consecutive weeks
- **QOS version display** — show computed QOS version in QuantumEngineWidgets index view
- **Field Manual v42 sync** — update About.tsx to reflect 58 patterns, 41 handlers, 7 jobs

*Self-assembly session complete. The system knows when you found your rhythm. And when the arc completed.*
