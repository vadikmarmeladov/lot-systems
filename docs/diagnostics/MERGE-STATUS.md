## 🚫 Push Issue

**Cannot push to remote** due to session ID mismatch:
- Debug branch session ID: `011CUfXMk1HWwKLuaR2WP6cu`
- Current session ID: `011CUs6NQRyEJRe6h8NDvobt`

Per Git configuration, pushes are only allowed to branches ending with the current session ID.

## 🔧 How to Deploy

You have **3 options**:

### Option 1: Manual Git Push (From Your Machine)
```bash
# Pull the debug branch
git fetch origin
git checkout claude/debug-loading-screen-011CUfXMk1HWwKLuaR2WP6cu

# Verify the commits are there
git log --oneline -5

# Push to remote
git push origin claude/debug-loading-screen-011CUfXMk1HWwKLuaR2WP6cu
```

### Option 2: Create Pull Request on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/vadikmarmeladov/lot-systems
2. Create PR from current work branch to debug branch
3. Merge the PR
4. DigitalOcean will auto-deploy

### Option 3: Direct Deployment
Since DigitalOcean watches the debug branch:
1. The commits are ready locally
2. Just need to push them to remote
3. DigitalOcean will auto-deploy
