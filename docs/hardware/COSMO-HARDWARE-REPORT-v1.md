# COSMO® Cube — Hardware Computer Design Report

**Session Report:** COSMO-HARDWARE-REPORT-v1.md  
**Classification:** Internal — Engineering + Strategic  
**Author:** Vadim Marmeladov, Inventor, COSMO® CIA  
**Date:** 2026-06-12  
**Status:** v1.0 — First complete hardware design session  

---

## Executive Summary

This report documents the complete design session for the COSMO® Cube — a hardware computer physically connected to the LOT Systems platform at lot-systems.com. The device is a flat, 40×40×5mm stainless steel ambient intelligence node: it receives pager-style notifications from the LOT AI engine, logs behavioral snapshots via a single Copy button, and captures environmental data through weather and AI-grade sensors.

**The device is:**
- A physical extension of the LOT operating system
- A behavioral signal collector (every button press is a data point)
- A hardware milestone for the COSMO® product line
- Designed for a 100-unit production run via PCBWay

**7 documents produced this session. All sub-documents are in `docs/hardware/`.**

## Design Decisions Log

### 1. Form Factor (4×4cm, 5mm)

**Decision:** Flat square, credit-card-like footprint.  
**Rationale:** Minimal desk presence. Sits flat or pockets like a money clip. The 5mm height is aggressive — requires custom thin LiPo (2.5mm), 0.8mm PCB, flush camera module. Achievable with careful stack-up (see COSMO-DEVICE-SPEC-v1.md §2, §5).  
**Challenge:** Camera lens height is the critical constraint. HM01B0 + M7 macro lens stacks to ~3.5mm — within budget with 0.3mm SS plates.

### 2. Main MCU: ESP32-S3

**Decision:** ESP32-S3-MINI-1U (Espressif).  
**Rationale:** Native 2.4GHz WiFi for LOT API polling. Built-in BLE 5.0. Hardware vector acceleration for on-device AI inference (notification filtering). Proven ecosystem. PCBWay stocks for turnkey assembly. 8MB flash sufficient for firmware + OTA slots.  
**Considered:** nRF5340 (lower power, BLE-only — would need separate WiFi chip), Raspberry Pi RP2350 (no native WiFi).

### 3. Display: SSD1327 1.0" Grayscale OLED

**Decision:** 128×128 grayscale OLED.  
**Rationale:** Perfect square format matches device footprint. 16-level grayscale enables elegant typography (LOT brand: no decorative colors, system-default aesthetic). Lower power than color LCD. 1.6mm module thickness fits 5mm budget.  
**Why not e-ink:** Too slow for real-time notification rendering and button feedback animations.

### 4. Camera: Himax HM01B0

**Decision:** Ultra-low-power CMOS imager, 320×320.  
**Rationale:** 1.1mW at 30fps — critical for battery life. CSP package (2.45×2.45mm) fits tight board. Used in Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense — proven embedded ecosystem. Face detection on-device (ESP32-S3 vector instructions) for Soul Sync gate.  
**Fallback:** OV2640 2MP for prototyping (thicker, more proven).

### 5. Wireless Charging Only (No USB)

**Decision:** Qi wireless charging, no USB port.  
**Rationale:** Aesthetic purity (no port breaks SS surface). IP54 integrity (no port to seal). Behavioral signal: charging with intention, not plugging in.  
**Engineering note:** BQ51013B + 30mm coil + ferrite fits in 5mm stack. Full charge in 2.5 hours.

### 6. Copy Button → LOT Log Tab

**Decision:** Single physical button = single behavioral gesture.  
**Rationale:** The Copy button is the hardware equivalent of a LOT journal entry. Press it, and your environmental context (temp, humidity, light, orientation) is logged to lot-systems.com/log with tag [COSMO® Cube]. Intentional. Deliberate. Logged.  
**Signal value:** Every button press timestamps a moment. Over time, press patterns become a behavioral signal (when do you reach for the device? What were conditions?).

### 7. Weather + AI-Grade Sensors

**Decision:** BME280 (weather) + ICM-42688-P (IMU) + APDS-9960 (gesture/light).  
**Rationale:** BME280 is industry-standard for temp/humidity/pressure — direct weather data. ICM-42688-P is TDK's highest-grade consumer IMU — detects motion, orientation, tap-to-wake, sleep posture. APDS-9960 enables gesture dismiss (wave to clear notification) and auto-sleep in dark/ambient conditions.  
**"AI-grade":** All three sensors have on-device signal processing, FIFO buffers, and hardware motion classification — no MCU cycles needed for basic event detection.

### 8. 2-Part 316L Stainless Steel Body

**Decision:** 316L (marine grade) SS, CNC machined, PCBWay.  
**Rationale:** 316L is the gold standard for portable electronics (Apple Watch Series 2+ uses 316L). Superior corrosion resistance vs 304. CNC machining from PCBWay delivers ±0.05mm tolerance — sufficient for flush camera, button, display cutouts.  
**Why 2 parts:** Back plate is flat (simple mirror polish). Front bezel has all cutouts (complex machining). Separation enables different finish per side.

## PDF Manual Plan — Status

v1.0 planned six audience-specific manuals via Pandoc or Figma. As of the
2026-07-20 session, the seven source documents are instead rendered directly
to PDF via pdfkit (`scripts/generate_cosmo_hardware_pdfs.cjs`) — no Pandoc
dependency, no external tool, consistent with how this repo already produces
the Badge Codex PDFs. One PDF per source document, not one per audience:

| PDF (docs/hardware/pdf/) | Source | Pages produced |
|---------------------------|--------|-----------------|
| COSMO-HARDWARE-REPORT-v1.pdf | This report | 24 |
| COSMO-DEVICE-SPEC-v1.pdf | Device specification | 24 |
| COSMO-BOM-v1.pdf | Bill of materials | 33 |
| COSMO-FIRMWARE-v1.pdf | Firmware architecture | 27 |
| COSMO-SOFTWARE-API-v1.pdf | LOT API integration | 18 |
| COSMO-MANUFACTURING-v1.pdf | Manufacturing guide | 18 |
| COSMO-CHARGER-SPEC-v1.pdf | Charger spec | 9 |

**Not yet done:** the audience-curated cuts (a 4-page Quick Start card, an
A5 print-trimmed retail insert) are a design pass, not a content problem —
they need the actual box/insert layout from COSMO-BOM-v1.md §10.2, which
depends on the box vendor being selected. Tracked as a Phase 3 (Production)
task, not blocking engineering.

---

## Strategic Notes

**Why this device first:**  
The COSMO® Cube is the simplest hardware node in the COSMO® product line. It is not a robot. It is not a companion AI. It is an ambient sensor + notification terminal + behavioral logger. It validates the hardware pipeline (PCBWay, firmware, LOT API integration) at low risk before COSMO® robotics.

**Why 100 units:**  
100 units is the minimum for meaningful market feedback and the minimum for PCBWay CNC pricing to be reasonable on SS enclosures. It is below MOQ risk for all components. Under $15K total. Fundable from current revenue.

**The Copy button is the signal:**  
Every time a LOT user presses the Copy button, they are making a behavioral gesture — "I am here, this is my context, log it." Over months, these presses form a pattern: when do they reach for the device? What light levels? What temperature? What time of day? This is Soul Sync data. It is the hardware's contribution to the Quantum Intent Engine.

**"Coffee time!" is the interface:**  
The LOT AI sends "Coffee time!" to the device. The user sees it on the mirror-finished square on their desk. They pause. They get coffee. The AI learned this pattern from their behavior. The hardware closes the loop — knowledge becomes action, action becomes habit, habit becomes identity.

## Session Continuation — 2026-07-20

The v1.0 design session (below) ran on `claude/brave-lamport-t9z5u8` and was
never merged — `docs/hardware/` did not exist on `master`. This continuation
session (`claude/brave-lamport-xwycvi`) carried the design forward:

1. **Ported all 7 documents** into this branch's `docs/hardware/` (they did
   not previously exist anywhere reachable from `master`).
2. **Corrected two inconsistencies** found on read-through:
   - `COSMO-CHARGER-SPEC-v1.md` §5 described charging with the mirror-polished
     (coil) side facing *up* — that would put the Qi coil away from the pad.
     Fixed to mirror-side-down, display-up (see that document's §6 Revision
     Notes).
   - `COSMO-SOFTWARE-API-v1.md` §2.2 modeled the backend as `SERIAL`-keyed raw
     SQL, disconnected from how this app actually persists data (Sequelize +
     umzug migrations, UUID keys — see `migrations/20240525154723_add-logs.cjs`
     and `src/server/models/log.ts`). Rewrote the schema and route handlers to
     match, and dropped the redundant `hardware_logs` table — a Copy button
     press is just a row in the existing `logs` table (see that document's §7
     Revision Notes).
3. **Generated the PDF manuals** that v1.0 only planned (`PDF Manual Plan`
   section above) — 7 PDFs, 153 pages total, via a new pdfkit script
   (`scripts/generate_cosmo_hardware_pdfs.cjs`).
4. **Attempted to read** `brand.lot-systems.com`, `lot-systems.com/about`, and
   `institute.lot-systems.com/cqgs.html` for brand-voice and CQGS context —
   all three returned HTTP 403 to this session's fetch tool. Brand voice and
   trademark conventions were instead drawn from in-repo sources
   (`README.md`, `docs/corporate/LOT_ROBOTICS_COSMO.md`,
   `docs/benchmark/LOT-DOCTRINE.md`), which already carry the same LOT®/COSMO®
   language.

No physical units exist yet — this remains a design-and-BOM deliverable, not
a shipped device. Nothing was implemented in `src/` this session: the API
route and DB migration snippets in `COSMO-SOFTWARE-API-v1.md` are reference
code for whoever builds Phase 1, not code running in the live app today.
