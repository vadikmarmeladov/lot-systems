## Feedback Signal Extracted

From USERSHIP_TRANSMISSION (v26, 2026-05-12) — verbatim:
> "Next: Pattern 45 — cognitive-load-release (planner cleared + journal depth + self-care within 24h). The decompression loop."

From v26 assembly log Deferred section — verbatim:
> "Pattern 45 (cognitive-load-release): planner cleared + journal depth + self-care completion within 24h. The decompression loop — when the person works down their task list, goes deep in writing, and completes a self-care cycle. The structural opposite of cognitive overload (Pattern 23)."

**Behavioral observation:**
- The prior pattern sequence (Patterns 38–44) built detection states for outward-facing and peak cognitive states: recovery arc (38), cognitive expansion (39), full cascade (40), resonant synthesis (41), deep work (42), intention loop (43), social resonance (44). Pattern 45 closes the cycle inward: it detects when the person releases accumulated cognitive load through structured decompression.
- 14 archetypes covered the full spectrum from depleted through social. Archetype 15 (Cognitive Liberator) introduces the post-decompression state: the person who works through load rather than accumulating it.
- Pattern 45 fires only when no overload patterns are active — this is intentional. Decompression is real only after the pressure has lifted.

## Delta Analysis

**Priority 1 — explicit next target (verbatim from v26 USERSHIP_TRANSMISSION):**
- Pattern 45 (cognitive-load-release): planner activity + deep journal entry + self-care completed, all within 24h. No active overload patterns required (AND-gate: release is authentic only without concurrent pressure).

**Priority 2 — logical extensions:**
- Archetype 15 (Cognitive Liberator): Pattern 45 creates a new behavioral archetype — the structural decompressor. selfcare/journal/planner dominant. Fires when cognitive-load-release, biofield-recovery-arc, or reflection-velocity are active.
- PatternRecognitionWidget name map: Pattern 45 needs a readable label. Added "Decompression loop closed."
- PatternRecognitionWidget QOS Trend: "Decompression active." indicator, consistent with deep-work-cascade and social-resonance-arc format.
- Logs.tsx RLSE handler: consistent with DWRK/SOCR/CASCADE/SYNTH military label format.
- selfAssembly.ts SIGNAL_MAP: cognitive-load-release routes to Cleanness Protocol (selfcare) module — decompression feeds the self-care assembly node.
- WIDGET_DEPENDENCY_MAP: cognitiveRelease node added with planner/journal/selfcare/log dependencies.

**Priority 3 — system record:**
- SystemProgressWidget SESSION_REPORTS: v27 entry appended
- USERSHIP_TRANSMISSION: updated to v27 / 2026-05-12. Next target stated: Pattern 46 (temporal-coherence-window)
- LOT_SYSTEMS_BRIEF.md: updated to v27 — pattern count (45), archetype table (15 physiological), assembly module count (15), status phase updated

**Deferred (Priority 3–4):**
- Pattern 46 (temporal-coherence-window): calendar + planner + intentions all active in 7d. The temporal planning rhythm — when the person's calendar, daily planning, and intention-setting are all synchronized. Stated as next in USERSHIP_TRANSMISSION v27.
- Archetype directive table expansion in SystemProgressWidget report view: now 15 archetypes; functional at this density but visual expansion pass deferred.
- WIDGET_DEPENDENCY_MAP v6 formal audit: cognitiveRelease added this session; a full dependency graph pass to verify all 2026-04+ widgets are mapped is deferred.
- Wiki v8: Assembly log v26–v27 phases not yet in wiki phase log. Wiki v7 covers through v25. Update when next session builds v28+.

## What Was Built

### `src/client/stores/intentionEngine.ts`

**Pattern 45 — cognitive-load-release** (inserted after Pattern 44, before `calculateUserState` call):
- `p45DayAgo`: 24-hour lookback window
- `p45Planner`: source='planner' in last 24h (planner activity present)
- `p45Journal`: source='journal' OR (source='log' AND signal='field_entry' AND wordCount≥20) in last 24h (deep entry)
- `p45SelfCare`: source='selfcare' in last 24h (self-care completed)
- `p45NoOverload`: no active patterns in ['anxiety-pattern', 'physiological-depletion', 'cognitive-overload', 'evening-overwhelm']
- All 4 conditions required (AND gate)
- Confidence: `0.68 + loopCount * 0.08`, capped at 0.90
- `suggestedWidget: 'journal'`, `suggestedTiming: 'passive'`
- Reason: "Planner active + deep journal entry + self-care completed within 24h. Decompression loop closed. Load released — document what changed."

**Archetype 15 — Cognitive Liberator** (appended after Social Connector, before closing `]` of PHYSIOLOGICAL_ARCHETYPES):
- `energyBands: ['moderate', 'high']`
- `dominantSources: ['selfcare', 'journal', 'planner']`
- `patternConditions: ['cognitive-load-release', 'biofield-recovery-arc', 'reflection-velocity']`
- `directive: 'Decompression loop complete. Load released. The system breathes.'`

**WIDGET_DEPENDENCY_MAP — cognitiveRelease node** (appended to decompression layer, after quantumOS):
- `cognitiveRelease: ['planner', 'journal', 'selfcare', 'log']`
- Comment: `// ── Decompression layer: cognitive load release node (2026-05-12 audit)`

### `src/client/components/Logs.tsx`

**RLSE handler** (inserted after SOCR handler, before direct_message_sent handler):
- Triggers on `log.event === 'cognitive_load_release'`
- Renders `<Block label="RLSE:" blockView>`
- Shows: "Cognitive load release" header
- Planner 24h count + Journal 24h count + Confidence
- Chain label: "Planner + journal depth + self-care within 24h"
- Consistent military format with DWRK, SOCR, CASCADE, SYNTH handlers

### `src/client/components/PatternRecognitionWidget.tsx`

**Name map addition** (after 'social-resonance-arc' entry):
- `'cognitive-load-release': 'Decompression loop closed'`

**QOS Trend view — decompression indicator** (after social-resonance-arc indicator block):
- Conditionally renders `"Decompression active."` in `uppercase tracking-widest text-xs`
- When `patterns.some(p => p.pattern === 'cognitive-load-release')` is true
- Non-intrusive, consistent with Pattern 42 and 44 indicator format

### `src/client/stores/selfAssembly.ts`

**SIGNAL_MAP additions** (after 'social_resonance_arc' entry):
- `'cognitive-load-release': 'selfcare'`
- `'cognitive_load_release': 'selfcare'`
- Routes decompression loop signals to Cleanness Protocol (selfcare) assembly module

### `src/client/components/SystemProgressWidget.tsx`

**SESSION_REPORTS v27 entry** (appended after v26 entry):
- date: '2026-05-12', session: 'QIE v27 — Pattern 45 · Archetype 15 · Cognitive Load Release · RLSE handler'
- 8-item assembled list documenting all changes

**USERSHIP_TRANSMISSION** (fully replaced):
- date: '2026-05-12'
- 10-line transmission: v27 header · built summary · Pattern 45 description · Archetype 15 description · QOS Trend indicator · RLSE handler note · selfAssembly routing · dep map node · DEPLOYED status · next target (Pattern 46)

### `LOT_SYSTEMS_BRIEF.md`

**Updates:**
- Status line: v19 → v27
- Pattern Recognition: updated to 45 types (v27 / 2026-05-12), summarizing patterns 14–44, adding Pattern 45 description
- Archetype section: split into 8 psychological archetypes (profile-based) + 15 physiological archetypes (QIE signal-based)
- Key differentiators: updated assembly module count (14 → 15) + added QuantumOS, 45 patterns, 15 archetypes

## Test Results

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Pattern 45 logic review | PASS — 4-condition AND gate: p45Planner ≥1, p45Journal ≥1, p45SelfCare ≥1, p45NoOverload. No mutation of prior pattern array. loopCount uses Math.min to prevent inflated confidence. |
| p45Journal dual-source filter | PASS — correctly handles both source='journal' (explicit journal events) and source='log' + signal='field_entry' + wordCount≥20 (deep log entries). typeof guard on wordCount prevents NaN comparison. |
| p45NoOverload guard | PASS — uses patterns.some() which safely returns false on empty array. Pattern names match existing pattern string keys. |
| Archetype 15 scoring | PASS — appended before closing `]`; scorer iterates full array; no mutation of prior entries; dominantSources use valid source names |
| PatternRecognitionWidget name map | PASS — trailing comma correct; existing entries unmodified |
| PatternRecognitionWidget QOS Trend indicator | PASS — `patterns` in scope from `engine.recognizedPatterns`; conditional renders inside qos-trend view block |
| Logs.tsx RLSE handler | PASS — inserted in correct else-if chain position after SOCR, before direct_message_sent; `log.event === 'cognitive_load_release'` matches intentionEngine pattern string (underscore form) |
| selfAssembly.ts SIGNAL_MAP | PASS — two entries (hyphen and underscore variants); 'selfcare' is a valid ModuleId; no existing entries modified |
| WIDGET_DEPENDENCY_MAP cognitiveRelease | PASS — appended after quantumOS with comment; all dep sources are valid QIE source names |
| SystemProgressWidget v27 entry | PASS — appended after v26 entry; closing `]` on SESSION_REPORTS preserved |
| USERSHIP_TRANSMISSION | PASS — date updated to 2026-05-12; v27 message references correct pattern names and next target (Pattern 46) |
| LOT_SYSTEMS_BRIEF.md | PASS — pattern count updated, archetype table expanded, assembly module count updated, status phase updated |

## What Was Deferred

- **Pattern 46 (temporal-coherence-window):** calendar + planner + intentions all active in 7d. The temporal rhythm — when the person's calendar, daily planning, and intention-setting are synchronized. Stated as next in USERSHIP_TRANSMISSION v27.
- **Archetype directive table expansion:** 15 archetypes now exist; the report view table was designed for 8. Still functional — no layout break. Needs a display pass when Archetype 16 is added.
- **WIDGET_DEPENDENCY_MAP v6 full audit:** cognitiveRelease added this session. A full audit to verify all 2026-04+ widgets are correctly mapped is deferred.
- **Wiki v8:** Phase log needs v26–v27 entry. Wiki v7 covers through v25. Defer to next session when v28 is ready.

## Next Session Recommendation

Build Pattern 46 (temporal-coherence-window: calendar widget active + planner used + intentions set, all within 7 days — the temporal planning rhythm, when time structure, daily action, and purpose are all synchronized). This closes the final gap in the planning layer: intention (Core) → planner (Routine Compiler) → calendar (Temporal Planner) all firing as a coherent unit.

*45 patterns. 15 archetypes. 15 modules. The Cube now reads decompression. The load was real. Now the breath is real.*
