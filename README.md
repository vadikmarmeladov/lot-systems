## 🌟 What is LOT?

LOT is a subscription service that distributes digital and physical necessities, basic wardrobes, organic self-care products, home and kids essentials.

But more importantly, LOT features the **Memory Engine** - a revolutionary AI-powered self-care companion that follows up on your wellness routines like a coach, and even more, like a life partner who truly knows you.

---

## 💎 The Memory Engine: Your Personal Self-care Vault

### Unlike Any Other Wellness App

Most health apps track data points. LOT builds your **Memory Story**.

The Memory Engine doesn't just ask questions - it **remembers every answer** and builds a progressively deeper understanding of your self-care preferences, habits, and patterns.

**Think of it as:**
- 🧘 A wellness coach who never forgets what you've shared
- 💬 A life partner who knows your body, mind, and soul preferences
- 📖 An invaluable vault of your personal settings, concentrated over time
- 🎯 A proactive companion that asks the right question at the right moment

### How It Works

**Day 1:**
- "What is your morning beverage preference?"
- You answer: "Tea"

**Day 2:**
- "Since you prefer tea, how do you usually prepare it?"
- You answer: "Loose leaf ritual"

**Day 3:**
- "You mentioned enjoying the loose leaf ritual. What's your favorite type?"
- You answer: "Green tea"

**Week 2:**
- "You love hot green loose leaf tea as a morning ritual. What do you typically do while drinking it?"
- You answer: "Quiet reading time"

**Month 2:**
- "Now that it's colder, you mentioned loving your morning tea ritual with reading. Has your tea preference changed with the season?"

**Notice:** Each question builds on the last. The Memory Engine **never forgets**. Your story grows richer over time.

### Your Memory Story Becomes Invaluable

Over weeks and months, your Memory Story becomes:

✨ **A vault of your personal wellness settings**
- What energizes you
- What calms you
- What rituals matter most
- How your preferences change with seasons
- What patterns emerge in your self-care

💪 **Body knowledge concentrated**
- Movement preferences
- Energy patterns
- Rest requirements
- Nutrition choices

🧠 **Mind patterns revealed**
- How you focus best
- When you need quiet
- What helps you think clearly
- Your creative rhythms

❤️ **Soul preferences honored**
- What brings you joy
- What rituals ground you
- How you recharge
- What makes you feel whole

**This isn't data collection. This is your life story, told through self-care choices.**

---

## 🔒 Your Story, Your Data

Unlike other wellness apps:
- ✅ Your Memory Story lives in **your database**, not an AI company's servers
- ✅ AI providers only execute questions - they **never remember** your data
- ✅ You can **export or delete** your entire story anytime
- ✅ Complete privacy by design

---

## ⚡ Quantum Operating System (QOS)

The **Quantum Operating System** is each person's private, client-side execution kernel — synthesising all signal streams into a single operating state in real time.

### QOS Operating Modes

| Mode | Trigger | System Behaviour |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| `maintenance` | Low signal density | Conserve — idle cadence |
| `recovery` | Depletion / overwhelm detected | Repair first — other tasks pause |
| `growth` | Steady positive engagement | Expand — absorb more |
| `peak` | High energy + clarity + intention | Optimal — full commitment |

### QOS Metrics (0–100 each)

- **Biofield Capacity** — self-care signal density vs active depletion events
- **Cognitive Load** — journal/memory/planner interactions in the last 24 h
- **Intention Resolution** — active intention × planner alignment × goal momentum
- **System Pressure** — `low / moderate / high / critical`

### Where QOS Surfaces

- **System Progress widget** → `System Report:` view → **QOS Kernel** panel
- **Self-Assembly map** → physiological cohort block shows live mode + pressure
- **Background monitor** — 30-min interval refresh, no user action needed
- **Console observability** — `[QOS] System pressure CRITICAL` on threshold breach

> The QOS does not direct the person — it mirrors their actual state with precision.
> A person in `recovery` mode does not need more tasks. They need to see that clearly.

## 🤖 AI Vendor Independence

LOT uses a revolutionary AI engine abstraction that gives you:

**5 AI Providers Supported:**
1. Together AI - Best for cost ($0.88/M tokens)
2. Google Gemini - Best balance ($1.25/M tokens)
3. Mistral AI - Best for EU privacy ($2/M tokens)
4. Anthropic Claude - Best quality ($3/M tokens)
5. OpenAI GPT-4 - Industry standard ($10/M tokens)

**Auto Mode:** System automatically uses the cheapest available engine, with automatic fallback if one provider has issues.

**Key Innovation:** Switch AI providers mid-conversation without losing ANY context. Your Memory Story stays intact because it lives in LOT's database, not the AI provider's memory.

See `AI-ENGINE-GUIDE.md` for complete documentation.

## 👤 Public Profile System (v1.0)

### Overview

LOT Systems now features a beautiful public profile system that allows users to share their System with the world while maintaining complete control over their privacy.

### Key Features

**Custom URLs:**
- Create memorable profile URLs: `https://lot-systems.com/u/vadik`
- Falls back to UUID-based URLs if custom URL not set
- Collision-safe: custom URLs are prioritized over ID matching

**Privacy Controls:**
Users can choose what to display on their public profile:
- ✅ **Name** - Always visible
- ✅ **Location** - City and country (optional)
- ✅ **Date** - Current date in readable format
- ✅ **Team Tags** - Professional affiliations (Admin, R&D, Usership, etc.)
- ✅ **Local Time** - Current time in user's timezone
- ✅ **Weather** - Real-time weather conditions
  - Sky conditions
  - Humidity (highlighted blue when ≥50%)
  - Temperature
  - Sunrise/Sunset times
- ✅ **Sound Status** - Current ambient sound settings
- ✅ **Memory Story** - Personal wellness narrative (optional)

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Consistent Styling** - Matches the System tab's Arial typography and spacing
- **Block Components** - Uses the same UI components as the main app
- **24px Spacing** - Identical gap-y-24 spacing for visual rhythm
- **Tag System** - Team tags display with colors (Suspended tags show in red)
- **Responsive Layout** - Works beautifully on all devices
- **Clean Footer** - "This is {Name}'s System powered by LOT" with return link

### Technical Implementation

**API Endpoint:**
```
GET /api/public/profile/:userIdOrUsername
```

**Custom URL Lookup Priority:**
1. Search by custom URL in user metadata
2. Fall back to user ID if custom URL not found
3. Return 404 if neither match

**Type Safety:**
```typescript
type PublicProfile = {
  firstName: string | null;
  lastName: string | null;
  city: string | null;
  country: string | null;
  localTime?: string;
  weather?: Weather;
  soundDescription?: string;
  memoryStory?: string;
  privacySettings: UserPrivacySettings;
  tags?: string[];
}
```

**Privacy Settings:**
```typescript
type UserPrivacySettings = {
  showCity: boolean;
  showLocalTime: boolean;
  showWeather: boolean;
  showSound: boolean;
  showMemoryStory: boolean;
  customUrl?: string;
}
```

### User Experience

**Example Public Profile:**
```

```

**Navigation:**
- Clean, minimal footer with clickable "LOT" button to return to main app
- No top navigation clutter
- Focus on content, not chrome

### Privacy by Default

**What's NOT Shared (Ever):**
- Password or authentication details
- Email address
- Private logs or journal entries
- Any data marked private in settings
- Payment or subscription information

**User Control:**
Users control every aspect of their public profile through Settings:
- Toggle each section on/off independently
- Set custom URL or use default UUID
- Update profile anytime
- Delete profile completely

### Cache Management

**PWA-Safe Design:**
- Cache-busting CSS version (`?v=20241210-001`)
- Separate entry point for public profiles
- No interference with main app functionality
- Users can switch between app and profiles seamlessly

**Files Involved:**
- `/src/client/components/PublicProfile.tsx` - Main component
- `/src/client/entries/public-profile.tsx` - Entry point
- `/src/server/routes/public-api.ts` - API endpoint
- `/templates/generic-spa.ejs` - HTML template

## 💡 The LOT Philosophy

**From data accumulation → TO memory densification**
**From vendor lock-in → TO AI independence**
**From surveillance → TO sovereignty**
**From metrics → TO meaning**

Self-care is not about tracking every data point.
It's about understanding patterns, preferences, and the story of who you're becoming.

**Your story. Your data. Your AI provider of choice.**

That's LOT Systems.
